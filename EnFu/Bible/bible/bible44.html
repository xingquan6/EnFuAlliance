margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 直到他藉着圣灵吩咐所拣选的使徒，以后被接上升的日子为止。 Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 他受害之后，用许多的凭据将自己活活地显给使徒看，四十天之久向他们显现，讲说　神国的事。 To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 耶稣和他们聚集的时候，嘱咐他们说：“不要离开耶路撒冷，要等候父所应许的，就是你们听见我说过的。 And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 约翰是用水施洗，但不多几日，你们要受圣灵的洗。” For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他们聚集的时候，问耶稣说：“主啊！你复兴以色列国，就在这时候吗？” When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 耶稣对他们说：“父凭着自己的权柄所定的时候、日期，不是你们可以知道的。 And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 但圣灵降临在你们身上，你们就必得着能力，并要在耶路撒冷，犹太全地，和撒玛利亚，直到地极，作我的见证。” But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 说了这话，他们正看的时候，他就被取上升，有一朵云彩把他接去，便看不见他了。 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 当他往上去，他们定睛望天的时候，忽然有两个人，身穿白衣，站在旁边，说： And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: “加利利人哪，你们为什么站着望天呢？这离开你们被接升天的耶稣，你们见他怎样往天上去，他还要怎样来。” Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 有一座山，名叫橄榄山，离耶路撒冷不远，约有安息日可走的路程。当下，门徒从那里回耶路撒冷去， Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 进了城，就上了所住的一间楼房。在那里有彼得、约翰、雅各、安得烈、腓力、多马、巴多罗买、马太、亚勒腓的儿子雅各、奋锐党的西门，和雅各的儿子(或作“兄弟”)犹大。 And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 这些人同着几个妇人，和耶稣的母亲马利亚，并耶稣的弟兄，都同心合意地恒切祷告。 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 那时，有许多人聚会，约有一百二十名，彼得就在弟兄中间站起来，说： And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: “弟兄们，圣灵藉大卫的口，在圣经上预言领人捉拿耶稣的犹大；这话是必须应验的。 Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 他本来列在我们数中，并且在使徒的职任上得了一分。 For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 这人用他作恶的工价买了一块田，以后身子仆倒，肚腹崩裂，肠子都流出来。 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 住在耶路撒冷的众人都知道这事，所以按着他们那里的话给那块田起名叫亚革大马，就是血田的意思。 And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 因为诗篇上写着，说：‘愿他的住处变为荒场，无人在内居住；’又说：‘愿别人得他的职分。’ For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 所以主耶稣在我们中间始终出入的时候， Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 就是从约翰施洗起，直到主离开我们被接上升的日子为止，必须从那常与我们作伴的人中立一位与我们同作耶稣复活的见证。” Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 于是选举两个人，就是那叫作巴撒巴，又称呼犹士都的约瑟和马提亚。 And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: - And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 众人就祷告说：“主啊，你知道万人的心，求你从这两个人中，指明你所拣选的是谁，叫他得这使徒的位分。这位分犹大已经丢弃，往自己的地方去了。” That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 于是众人为他们摇签，摇出马提亚来；他就和十一个使徒同列。 And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_2">使徒行传 2</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 五旬节到了，门徒都聚集在一处。 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 忽然，从天上有响声下来；好象一阵大风吹过，充满了他们所坐的屋子； And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 又有舌头如火焰显现出来，分开落在他们各人头上。 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他们就都被圣灵充满，按着圣灵所赐的口才，说起别国的话来。 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 那时，有虔诚的犹太人从天下各国来，住在耶路撒冷。 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 这声音一响，众人都来聚集，各人听见门徒用众人的乡谈说话，就甚纳闷； Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 都惊讶希奇说：“看哪！这说话的不都是加利利人吗？ And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 我们各人怎么听见他们说我们生来所用的乡谈呢？ And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 我们帕提亚人、玛代人、以拦人，和住在美索不达米亚、犹太、加帕多家、本都、亚细亚、 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 弗吕家、旁非利亚、埃及的人，并靠近古利奈的利比亚一带地方的人，从罗马来的客旅中，或是犹太人，或是进犹太教的人， Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 革哩底和阿拉伯人，都听见他们用我们的乡谈，讲说　神的大作为。” Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 众人就都惊讶猜疑，彼此说：“这是什么意思呢？” And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 还有人讥诮，说：“他们无非是新酒灌满了。” Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 彼得和十一个使徒站起，高声说：“犹太人和一切住在耶路撒冷的人哪！这件事你们当知道，也当侧耳听我的话。 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 你们想这些人是醉了，其实不是醉了，因为时候刚到巳初。 For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 这正是先知约珥所说的： But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: ‘　神说：在末后的日子，我要将我的灵浇灌凡有血气的，你们的儿女要说预言，你们的少年人要见异象，老年人要作异梦。 And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 在那些日子，我要将我的灵浇灌我的仆人和使女，他们就要说预言。 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 在天上我要显出奇事，在地下我要显出神迹，有血，有火，有烟雾。 And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 日头要变为黑暗，月亮要变为血，这都在主大而明显的日子未到以前。 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 到那时候，凡求告主名的，就必得救。’ And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: “以色列人哪！请听我的话：　神藉着拿撒勒人耶稣在你们中间施行异能、奇事、神迹，将他证明出来，这是你们自己知道的。 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 他既按着　神的定旨、先见，被交与人，你们就藉着无法之人的手，把他钉在十字架上杀了。 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 　神却将死的痛苦解释了，叫他复活，因为他原不能被死拘禁。 Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 大卫指着他说：‘我看见主常在我眼前，他在我右边，叫我不至于摇动。 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 所以我心里欢喜，我的灵(原文作“舌”)快乐，并且我的肉身要安居在指望中。 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 因你必不将我的灵魂撇在阴间，也不叫你的圣者见朽坏。 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 你已将生命的道路指示我，必叫我因见你的面(或作“叫我在你面前”)，得着满足的快乐。’ Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: “弟兄们！先祖大卫的事，我可以明明地对你们说，他死了，也葬埋了，并且他的坟墓直到今日还在我们这里。 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 大卫既是先知，又晓得　神曾向他起誓，要从他的后裔中立一位坐在他的宝座上， Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 就预先看明这事，讲论基督复活说：‘他的灵魂不撇在阴间；他的肉身也不见朽坏。’ He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 这耶稣，　神已经叫他复活了，我们都为这事作见证。 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 他既被　神的右手高举(或作“他既高举在　神的右边”)，又从父受了所应许的圣灵，就把你们所看见所听见的，浇灌下来。 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 大卫并没有升到天上，但自己说：‘主对我主说：你坐在我的右边， For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 等我使你仇敌作你的脚凳。’ Until I make thy foes thy footstool.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 故此，以色列全家当确实地知道，你们钉在十字架上的这位耶稣，　神已经立他为主为基督了。” Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 众人听见这话，觉得扎心，就对彼得和其余的使徒说：“弟兄们，我们当怎样行？” Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 彼得说：“你们各人要悔改，奉耶稣基督的名受洗，叫你们的罪得赦，就必领受所赐的圣灵； Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 因为这应许是给你们和你们的儿女，并一切在远方的人，就是主我们　神所召来的。” For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 彼得还用许多话作见证，劝勉他们说：“你们当救自己脱离这弯曲的世代。” And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 于是领受他话的人，就受了洗，那一天，门徒约添了三千人， Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 都恒心遵守使徒的教训，彼此交接、掰饼、祈祷。 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 众人都惧怕。使徒又行了许多奇事神迹。 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 信的人都在一处，凡物公用， And all that believed were together, and had all things common;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 并且卖了田产、家业，照各人所需用的分给各人。 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 他们天天同心合意恒切地在殿里，且在家中掰饼，存着欢喜、诚实的心用饭， And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 赞美　神，得众民的喜爱。主将得救的人天天加给他们。 Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_3">使徒行传 3</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 申初祷告的时候，彼得、约翰上圣殿去。 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 有一个人，生来是瘸腿的，天天被人抬来，放在殿的一个门口(那门名叫美门)，要求进殿的人周济。 And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 他看见彼得、约翰将要进殿，就求他们周济。 Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 彼得、约翰定睛看他。彼得说：“你看我们。” And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 那人就留意看他们，指望得着什么。 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 彼得说：“金银我都没有，只把我所有的给你：我奉拿撒勒人耶稣基督的名，叫你起来行走！” Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 于是拉着他的右手，扶他起来，他的脚和踝子骨，立刻健壮了。 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 就跳起来，站着，又行走。同他们进了殿，走着，跳着，赞美　神。 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 百姓都看见他行走，赞美　神； And all the people saw him walking and praising God:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 认得他是那素常坐在殿的美门口求周济的，就因他所遇着的事满心希奇、惊讶。 And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 那人正在称为所罗门的廊下，拉着彼得、约翰，众百姓一齐跑到他们那里，很觉希奇。 And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 彼得看见，就对百姓说：“以色列人哪！为什么把这事当作希奇呢？为什么定睛看我们，以为我们凭自己的能力和虔诚使这人行走呢？ And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的　神，就是我们列祖的　神，已经荣耀了他的仆人耶稣(“仆人”或作“儿子”)；你们却把他交付彼拉多。彼拉多定意要释放他，你们竟在彼拉多面前弃绝了他。 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 你们弃绝了那圣洁公义者，反求着释放一个凶手给你们。 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 你们杀了那生命的主，　神却叫他从死里复活了；我们都是为这事作见证。 And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 我们因信他的名，他的名便叫你们所看见所认识的这人健壮了；正是他所赐的信心，叫这人在你们众人面前全然好了。 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 弟兄们，我晓得你们作这事是出于不知，你们的官长也是如此。 And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 但　神曾藉众先知的口，预言基督将要受害，就这样应验了。 But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 所以你们当悔改归正，使你们的罪得以涂抹，这样，那安舒的日子就必从主面前来到。 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 主也必差遣所预定给你们的基督耶稣降临。 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 天必留他，等到万物复兴的时候，就是　神从创世以来，藉着圣先知的口所说的。 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 摩西曾说：‘主　神要从你们弟兄中间给你们兴起一位先知象我，凡他向你们所说的，你们都要听从。 For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 凡不听从那先知的，必要从民中全然灭绝。’ And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 从撒母耳以来的众先知，凡说预言的，也都说到这些日子。 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 你们是先知的子孙，也承受　神与你们祖宗所立的约，就是对亚伯拉罕说：‘地上万族都要因你的后裔得福。’ Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 　神既兴起他的仆人(或作“儿子”)，就先差他到你们这里来，赐福给你们，叫你们各人回转，离开罪恶。” Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_4">使徒行传 4</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 使徒对百姓说话的时候，祭司们和守殿官，并撒都该人，忽然来了。 And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 因他们教训百姓，本着耶稣，传说死人复活，就很烦恼； Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 于是下手拿住他们，因为天已经晚了，就把他们押到第二天。 And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 但听道之人有许多信的，男丁数目约到五千。 Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 第二天，官府、长老和文士，在耶路撒冷聚会， And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 又有大祭司亚那和该亚法、约翰、亚历山大，并大祭司的亲族都在那里。 And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 叫使徒站在当中，就问他们说：“你们用什么能力，奉谁的名，作这事呢？” And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 那时，彼得被圣灵充满，对他们说： Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: “治民的官府和长老啊，倘若今日，因为在残疾人身上所行的善事，查问我们他是怎么得了痊愈； If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 你们众人和以色列百姓都当知道，站在你们面前的这人得痊愈，是因你们所钉十字架、　神叫他从死里复活的拿撒勒人耶稣基督的名。 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 他是你们匠人所弃的石头，已成了房角的头块石头。 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 除他以外，别无拯救；因为在天下人间，没有赐下别的名，我们可以靠着得救。” Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他们见彼得、约翰的胆量，又看出他们原是没有学问的小民，就希奇，认明他们是跟过耶稣的； Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 又看见那治好了的人和他们一同站着，就无话可驳。 And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 于是吩咐他们从公会出去，就彼此商议说： But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: “我们当怎样办这两个人呢？因为他们诚然行了一件明显的神迹，凡住耶路撒冷的人都知道，我们也不能说没有。 Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 惟恐这事越发传扬在民间，我们必须恐吓他们，叫他们不再奉这名对人讲论。” But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 于是叫了他们来，禁止他们总不可奉耶稣的名讲论教训人。 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 彼得、约翰说：“听从你们，不听从　神，这在　神面前合理不合理，你们自己酌量吧！ But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 我们所看见所听见的，不能不说。” For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 官长为百姓的缘故，想不出法子刑罚他们，又恐吓一番，把他们释放了。这是因众人为所行的奇事，都归荣耀与　神。 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 原来藉着神迹医好的那人有四十多岁了。 For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 二人既被释放，就到会友那里去，把祭司长和长老所说的话都告诉他们。 And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 他们听见了，就同心合意地高声向　神说：“主啊！你是造天、地、海，和其中万物的， And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 你曾藉着圣灵，托你仆人、我们祖宗大卫的口，说：‘外邦为什么争闹？万民为什么谋算虚妄的事？ Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 世上的君王一齐起来，臣宰也聚集，要敌挡主，并主的受膏者(或作“基督”)。’ The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 希律和本丢彼拉多，外邦人和以色列民，果然在这城里聚集，要攻打你所膏的圣仆耶稣(“仆”或作“子”)， For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 成就你手和你意旨所预定必有的事。 For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: - And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 他们恐吓我们，现在求主鉴察：一面叫你仆人大放胆量，讲你的道，一面伸出你的手来医治疾病，并且使神迹奇事因着你圣仆耶稣的名行出来(“仆”或作“子”)。” By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 祷告完了，聚会的地方震动，他们就都被圣灵充满，放胆讲论　神的道。 And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 那许多信的人都是一心一意的，没有一人说他的东西有一样是自己的，都是大家公用。 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 使徒大有能力，见证主耶稣复活；众人也都蒙大恩。 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 内中也没有一个缺乏的，因为人人将田产房屋都卖了，把所卖的价银拿来，放在使徒脚前； Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 照各人所需用的，分给各人。 And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 有一个利未人，生在居比路，名叫约瑟，使徒称他为巴拿巴(巴拿巴翻出来就是劝慰子)。 And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 他有田地，也卖了，把价银拿来，放在使徒脚前。 Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_5">使徒行传 5</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 有一个人，名叫亚拿尼亚，同他的妻子撒非喇，卖了田产， But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 把价银私自留下几分，他的妻子也知道，其余的几分拿来放在使徒脚前。 And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 彼得说：“亚拿尼亚！为什么撒但充满了你的心，叫你欺哄圣灵，把田地的价银私自留下几分呢？ But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 田地还没有卖，不是你自己的吗？既卖了，价银不是你作主吗？你怎么心里起这意念呢？你不是欺哄人，是欺哄　神了。” Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 亚拿尼亚听见这话，就仆倒，断了气；听见的人都甚惧怕。 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 有些少年人起来，把他包裹，抬出去埋葬了。 And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 约过了三小时，他的妻子进来，还不知道这事。 And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 彼得对她说：“你告诉我，你们卖田地的价银，就是这些吗？”她说：“就是这些。” And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 彼得说：“你们为什么同心试探主的灵呢？埋葬你丈夫之人的脚已到门口，他们也要把你抬出去。” Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 妇人立刻仆倒在彼得脚前，断了气。那些少年人进来，见她已经死了，就抬出去，埋在她丈夫旁边。 Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 全教会和听见这事的人，都甚惧怕。 And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 主借使徒的手在民间行了许多神迹奇事；(他们(或作“信的人”)都同心合意地在所罗门的廊下。 And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 其余的人没有一个敢贴近他们；百姓却尊重他们。 And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 信而归主的人越发增添，连男带女很多。) And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 甚至有人将病人抬到街上，放在床上或褥子上，指望彼得过来的时候，或者得他的影儿照在什么人身上。 Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 还有许多人带着病人和被污鬼缠磨的，从耶路撒冷四围的城邑来，全都得了医治。 There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 大祭司和他的一切同人，就是撒都该教门的人，都起来，满心忌恨， Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 就下手拿住使徒，收在外监。 And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 但主的使者夜间开了监门，领他们出来， But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 说：“你们去站在殿里，把这生命的道都讲给百姓听。” Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 使徒听了这话，天将亮的时候就进殿里去教训人。大祭司和他的同人来了，叫齐公会的人和以色列族的众长老，就差人到监里去，要把使徒提出来。 And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 但差役到了，不见他们在监里，就回来禀报说： But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: “我们看见监牢关得极妥当，看守的人也站在门外，及至开了门，里面一个人都不见。” Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 守殿官和祭司长听见这话，心里犯难，不知这事将来如何。 Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 有一个人来禀报说：“你们收在监里的人，现在站在殿里教训百姓。” Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 于是守殿官和差役去带使徒来，并没有用强暴，因为怕百姓用石头打他们。 Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 带到了，便叫使徒站在公会前，大祭司问他们说： And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: “我们不是严严地禁止你们，不可奉这名教训人吗？你们倒把你们的道理充满了耶路撒冷，想要叫这人的血归到我们身上！” Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 彼得和众使徒回答说：“顺从　神，不顺从人，是应当的。 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 你们挂在木头上杀害的耶稣，我们祖宗的　神已经叫他复活。 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 　神且用右手将他高举(或作“他就是　神高举在自己的右边”)，叫他作君王，作救主，将悔改的心和赦罪的恩赐给以色列人。 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 我们为这事作见证。　神赐给顺从之人的圣灵，也为这事作见证。” And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 公会的人听见就极其恼怒，想要杀他们。 When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 但有一个法利赛人，名叫迦玛列，是众百姓所敬重的教法师，在公会中站起来，吩咐人把使徒暂且带到外面去， Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 就对众人说：“以色列人哪，论到这些人，你们应当小心怎样办理。 And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 从前丢大起来，自夸为大，附从他的人约有四百，他被杀后，附从他的全都散了，归于无有。 For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 此后，报名上册的时候，又有加利利的犹大起来，引诱些百姓跟从他，他也灭亡，附从他的人也都四散了。 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 现在，我劝你们不要管这些人，任凭他们吧！他们所谋的、所行的，若是出于人，必要败坏； And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 若是出于　神，你们就不能败坏他们，恐怕你们倒是攻击　神了。” But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 公会的人听从了他，便叫使徒来，把他们打了，又吩咐他们不可奉耶稣的名讲道，就把他们释放了。 And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 他们离开公会，心里欢喜，因被算是配为这名受辱。 And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 他们就每日在殿里、在家里，不住地教训人，传耶稣是基督。 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_6">使徒行传 6</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 那时，门徒增多，有说希腊话的犹太人向希伯来人发怨言，因为在天天的供给上忽略了他们的寡妇。 And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 十二使徒叫众门徒来，对他们说：“我们撇下　神的道去管理饭食，原是不合宜的。 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 所以弟兄们，当从你们中间选出七个有好名声，被圣灵充满，智慧充足的人，我们就派他们管理这事。 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 叫他们站在使徒面前。使徒祷告了，就按手在他们头上。 Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 　神的道兴旺起来。在耶路撒冷门徒数目加增的甚多，也有许多祭司信从了这道。 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 司提反满得恩惠、能力，在民间行了大奇事和神迹。 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 当时有称利百地拿会堂的几个人，并有古利奈、亚力山太、基利家、亚细亚各处会堂的几个人，都起来和司提反辩论。 Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 司提反是以智慧和圣灵说话，众人敌挡不住， And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 就买出人来说：“我们听见他说谤讟摩西和　神的话。” Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他们又耸动了百姓、长老，并文士，就忽然来捉拿他，把他带到公会去， And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 设下假见证，说：“这个人说话，不住地糟践圣所和律法。 And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 我们曾听见他说，这拿撒勒人耶稣要毁坏此地，也要改变摩西所交给我们的规条。” For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 在公会里坐着的人，都定睛看他，见他的面貌，好象天使的面貌。 And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_7">使徒行传 7</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 大祭司就说：“这些事果然有吗？” Then said the high priest, Are these things so?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 司提反说：“诸位父兄请听！当日我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕在美索不达米亚还未住哈兰的时候，荣耀的　神向他显现， And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 对他说：‘你要离开本地和亲族，往我所要指示你的地方去。’ And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他就离开迦勒底人之地，住在哈兰。他父亲死了以后，　神使他从那里搬到你们现在所住之地。 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 在这地方　神并没有给他产业，连立足之地也没有给他；但应许要将这地赐给他和他的后裔为业；那时他还没有儿子。 And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 　神说：‘他的后裔必寄居外邦，那里的人要叫他们作奴仆，苦待他们四百年。’ And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 　神又说：‘使他们作奴仆的那国，我要惩罚。以后他们要出来，在这地方事奉我。’ And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 　神又赐他割礼的约。于是亚伯拉罕生了以撒，第八日给他行了割礼。以撒生雅各，雅各生十二位先祖。 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: “先祖嫉妒约瑟，把他卖到埃及去，　神却与他同在， And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 救他脱离一切苦难，又使他在埃及王法老面前得恩典，有智慧。法老就派他作埃及国的宰相兼管全家。 And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 后来埃及和迦南全地遭遇饥荒，大受艰难，我们的祖宗就绝了粮。 Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 雅各听见在埃及有粮，就打发我们的祖宗初次往那里去。 But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 第二次约瑟与弟兄们相认，他的亲族也被法老知道了。 And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 约瑟就打发弟兄，请父亲雅各和全家七十五个人都来。 Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 于是雅各下了埃及，后来他和我们的祖宗都死在那里； So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 又被带到示剑，葬于亚伯拉罕在示剑用银子从哈抹子孙买来的坟墓里。 And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: “及至　神应许亚伯拉罕的日期将到，以色列民在埃及兴盛众多， But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 直到有不晓得约瑟的新王兴起。 Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他用诡计待我们的宗族，苦害我们的祖宗，叫他们丢弃婴孩，使婴孩不能存活。 The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 那时，摩西生下来，俊美非凡，在他父亲家里抚养了三个月。 In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 他被丢弃的时候，法老的女儿拾了去，养为自己的儿子。 And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 摩西学了埃及人一切的学问，说话行事都有才能。 And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: “他将到四十岁，心中起意去看望他的弟兄以色列人； And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 到了那里，见他们一个人受冤屈，就护庇他，为那受欺压的人报仇，打死了那埃及人。 And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 他以为弟兄必明白　神是借他的手搭救他们；他们却不明白。 For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 第二天，遇见两个以色列人争斗，就劝他们和睦，说：‘你们二位是弟兄，为什么彼此欺负呢？’ And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 那欺负邻舍的把他推开，说：‘谁立你作我们的首领和审判官呢？ But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 难道你要杀我，象昨天杀那埃及人吗？’ Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 摩西听见这话就逃走了，寄居于米甸；在那里生了两个儿子。 Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: “过了四十年，在西奈山的旷野，有一位天使从荆棘火焰中向摩西显现。 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 摩西见了那异象，便觉希奇，正进前观看的时候，有主的声音说： When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: ‘我是你列祖的　神，就是亚伯拉罕的　神，以撒的　神，雅各的　神。’摩西战战兢兢，不敢观看。 Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 主对他说：‘把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站之地是圣地。 Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 我的百姓在埃及所受的困苦，我实在看见了，他们悲叹的声音，我也听见了。我下来要救他们。你来！我要差你往埃及去。’ I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 这摩西，就是百姓弃绝说‘谁立你作我们的首领和审判官’的；　神却借那在荆棘中显现之使者的手，差派他作首领作救赎的。 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 这人领百姓出来，在埃及、在红海、在旷野，四十年间行了奇事神迹。 He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 那曾对以色列人说‘　神要从你们弟兄中间给你们兴起一位先知象我’的，就是这位摩西。 This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 这人曾在旷野会中，和西奈山上，与那对他说话的天使同在，又与我们的祖宗同在，并且领受活泼的圣言传给我们。 This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 我们的祖宗不肯听从，反弃绝他，心里归向埃及， To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 对亚伦说：‘你且为我们造些神像，在我们前面引路；因为领我们出埃及地的那个摩西，我们不知道他遭了什么事。’ Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 那时，他们造了一个牛犊，又拿祭物献给那像，欢喜自己手中的工作。 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 　神就转脸不顾，任凭他们事奉天上的日月星辰，正如先知书上所写的说：‘以色列家啊，你们四十年间在旷野，岂是将牺牲和祭物献给我吗？ Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 你们抬着摩洛的帐幕和理番神的星，就是你们所造为要敬拜的像。因此，我要把你们迁到巴比伦外去。’ Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: “我们的祖宗在旷野，有法柜的帐幕，是　神吩咐摩西叫他照所看见的样式作的。 Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 这帐幕，我们的祖宗相继承受。当　神在他们面前赶出外邦人去的时候，他们同约书亚把帐幕搬进承受为业之地，直存到大卫的日子。 Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 大卫在　神面前蒙恩，祈求为雅各的　神预备居所； Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 却是所罗门为　神造成殿宇。 But Solomon built him an house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 其实，至高者并不住人手所造的，就如先知所言： Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: ‘主说：天是我的座位，地是我的脚凳，你们要为我造何等的殿宇？那里是我安息的地方呢？ Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 这一切不都是我手所造的吗？’ Hath not my hand made all these things?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: “你们这硬着颈项，心与耳未受割礼的人，常时抗拒圣灵！你们的祖宗怎样，你们也怎样。 Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">52: 哪一个先知不是你们祖宗逼迫呢？他们也把预先传说那义者要来的人杀了。如今你们又把那义者卖了，杀了。 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">53: 你们受了天使所传的律法，竟不遵守。” Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">54: 众人听见这话，就极其恼怒，向司提反咬牙切齿。 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">55: 但司提反被圣灵充满，定睛望天，看见　神的荣耀，又看见耶稣站在　神的右边， But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">56: 就说：“我看见天开了，人子站在　神的右边。” And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">57: 众人大声喊叫，捂着耳朵，齐心拥上前去； Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">58: 把他推到城外，用石头打他。作见证的人把衣裳放在一个少年人名叫扫罗的脚前。 And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">59: 他们正用石头打的时候，司提反呼吁主说：“求主耶稣接收我的灵魂；” And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">60: 又跪下大声喊着说：“主啊！不要将这罪归于他们。”说了这话，就睡了。扫罗也喜悦他被害。 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_8">使徒行传 8</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 从这日起，耶路撒冷的教会大遭逼迫，除了使徒以外，门徒都分散在犹太和撒玛利亚各处。 And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 有虔诚的人把司提反埋葬了，为他捶胸大哭。 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 扫罗却残害教会，进各人的家，拉着男女下在监里。 As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 那些分散的人往各处去传道。 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 腓利下撒玛利亚城去，宣讲基督。 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 众人听见了，又看见腓利所行的神迹，就同心合意地听从他的话。 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 因为有许多人被污鬼附着，那些鬼大声呼叫，从他们身上出来；还有许多瘫痪的、瘸腿的，都得了医治。 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 在那城里，就大有欢喜。 And there was great joy in that city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 有一个人，名叫西门，向来在那城里行邪术，妄自尊大，使撒玛利亚的百姓惊奇； But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 无论大小，都听从他，说：“这人就是那称为　神的大能者。” To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 他们听从他，因他久用邪术，使他们惊奇。 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 及至他们信了腓利所传　神国的福音，和耶稣基督的名，连男带女就受了洗。 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 西门自己也信了；既受了洗，就常与腓利在一处，看见他所行的神迹和大异能，就甚惊奇。 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 使徒在耶路撒冷，听见撒玛利亚人领受了　神的道，就打发彼得、约翰往他们那里去。 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 两个人到了，就为他们祷告，要叫他们受圣灵。 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 因为圣灵还没有降在他们一个人身上。他们只奉主耶稣的名受了洗。 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 于是使徒按手在他们头上，他们就受了圣灵。 Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 西门看见使徒按手，便有圣灵赐下，就拿钱给使徒， And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 说：“把这权柄也给我，叫我手按着谁，谁就可以受圣灵。” Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 彼得说：“你的银子和你一同灭亡吧！因你想　神的恩赐是可以用钱买的。 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 你在这道上无分无关；因为在　神面前，你的心不正。 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 你当懊悔你这罪恶，祈求主，或者你心里的意念可得赦免。 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 我看出你正在苦胆之中，被罪恶捆绑。” For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 西门说：“愿你们为我求主，叫你们所说的，没有一样临到我身上。” Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 使徒既证明主道，而且传讲，就回耶路撒冷去，一路在撒玛利亚好些村庄传扬福音。 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 有主的一个使者对腓利说：“起来！向南走，往那从耶路撒冷下迦萨的路上去。”那路是旷野。 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 腓利就起身去了。不料，有一个埃提阿伯(即“古实”，见以赛亚十八章一节)人，是个有大权的太监，在埃提阿伯女王干大基的手下总管银库，他上耶路撒冷礼拜去了。 And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 现在回来，在车上坐着，念先知以赛亚的书。 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 圣灵对腓利说：“你去！贴近那车走。” Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 腓利就跑到太监那里，听见他念先知以赛亚的书。便问他说：“你所念的，你明白吗？” And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 他说：“没有人指教我，怎能明白呢？”于是请腓利上车，与他同坐。 And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 他所念的那段经，说：“他象羊被牵到宰杀之地，又象羊羔在剪毛的人手下无声，他也是这样不开口。 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 他卑微的时候，人不按公义审判他(原文作“他的审判被夺去”)，谁能述说他的世代？因为他的生命从地上夺去。” In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 太监对腓利说：“请问，先知说这话是指着谁，是指着自己呢？是指着别人呢？” And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 腓利就开口从这经上起，对他传讲耶稣。 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 二人正往前走，到了有水的地方，太监说：“看哪！这里有水，我受洗有什么妨碍呢？”(有古卷在此有 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 腓利说：“你若是一心相信，就可以。”他回答说：“我信耶稣基督是　神的儿子。”)。 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 于是吩咐车站住，腓利和太监二人同下水里去，腓利就给他施洗。 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 从水里上来，主的灵把腓利提了去，太监也不再见他了，就欢欢喜喜地走路。 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 后来有人在亚锁都遇见腓利，他走遍那地方，在各城宣传福音，直到该撒利亚。 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_9">使徒行传 9</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 扫罗仍然向主的门徒口吐威吓凶杀的话，去见大祭司， And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 求文书给大马色的各会堂，若是找着信奉这道的人，无论男女，都准他捆绑带到耶路撒冷。 And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 扫罗行路，将到大马色，忽然从天上发光，四面照着他； And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他就仆倒在地，听见有声音对他说：“扫罗！扫罗！你为什么逼迫我？” And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他说：“主啊！你是谁？”主说：“我就是你所逼迫的耶稣。 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 起来！进城去，你所当作的事，必有人告诉你。” And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 同行的人站在那里，说不出话来，听见声音，却看不见人。 And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 扫罗从地上起来，睁开眼睛，竟不能看见什么。有人拉他的手，领他进了大马色； And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 三日不能看见，也不吃也不喝。 And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 当下，在大马色有一个门徒，名叫亚拿尼亚；主在异象中对他说：“亚拿尼亚。”他说：“主，我在这里。” And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 主对他说：“起来！往直街去，在犹大的家里，访问一个大数人，名叫扫罗；他正祷告， And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 又看见了一个人，名叫亚拿尼亚，进来按手在他身上，叫他能看见。” And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 亚拿尼亚回答说：“主啊，我听见许多人说，这人怎样在耶路撒冷多多苦害你的圣徒， Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 并且他在这里有从祭司长得来的权柄捆绑一切求告你名的人。” And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 主对亚拿尼亚说：“你只管去。他是我所拣选的器皿，要在外邦人和君王，并以色列人面前宣扬我的名。 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 我也要指示他，为我的名必须受许多的苦难。” For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 亚拿尼亚就去了，进入那家，把手按在扫罗身上说：“兄弟扫罗，在你来的路上，向你显现的主，就是耶稣，打发我来，叫你能看见，又被圣灵充满。” And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 扫罗的眼睛上，好象有鳞立刻掉下来，他就能看见，于是起来受了洗； And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 吃过饭就健壮了。扫罗和大马色的门徒同住了些日子， And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 就在各会堂里宣传耶稣，说他是　神的儿子。 And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 凡听见的人都惊奇，说：“在耶路撒冷残害求告这名的，不是这人吗？并且他到这里来，特要捆绑他们，带到祭司长那里。” But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 但扫罗越发有能力，驳倒住大马色的犹太人，证明耶稣是基督。 But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 过了好些日子，犹太人商议要杀扫罗； And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 但他们的计谋被扫罗知道了。他们又昼夜在城门守候，要杀他。 But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 他的门徒就在夜间用筐子把他从城墙上缒下去。 Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 扫罗到了耶路撒冷，想与门徒结交，他们却都怕他，不信他是门徒。 And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 惟有巴拿巴接待他，领去见使徒，把他在路上怎么看见主，主怎么向他说话，他在大马色怎么奉耶稣的名放胆传道，都述说出来。 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 于是扫罗在耶路撒冷和门徒出入来往， And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 奉主的名放胆传道，并与说希腊话的犹太人讲论辩驳；他们却想法子要杀他。 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 弟兄们知道了就送他下该撒利亚，打发他往大数去。 Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 那时犹太、加利利、撒玛利亚，各处的教会都得平安，被建立；凡事敬畏主，蒙圣灵的安慰，人数就增多了。 Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 彼得周流四方的时候，也到了居住吕大的圣徒那里； And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 遇见一个人，名叫以尼雅，得了瘫痪，在褥子上躺卧八年。 And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 彼得对他说：“以尼雅，耶稣基督医好你了，起来！收拾你的褥子。”他就立刻起来了。 And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 凡住吕大和沙仑的人都看见了他，就归服主。 And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 在约帕有一个女徒，名叫大比大，翻希腊话就是多加。(“多加”就是“羚羊”的意思)；她广行善事，多施周济。 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 当时，她患病而死，有人把她洗了，停在楼上。 And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 吕大原与约帕相近；门徒听见彼得在那里，就打发两个人去见他，央求他说：“快到我们那里去，不要耽延。” And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 彼得就起身和他们同去；到了，便有人领他上楼。众寡妇都站在彼得旁边哭，拿多加与她们同在时所做的里衣外衣给他看。 Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 彼得叫她们都出去，就跪下祷告，转身对着死人说：“大比大！起来！”她就睁开眼睛，见了彼得，便坐起来。 But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 彼得伸手扶她起来，叫众圣徒和寡妇进去，把多加活活地交给他们。 And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 这事传遍了约帕，就有许多人信了主。 And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 此后，彼得在约帕一个硝皮匠西门的家里住了多日。 And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_10">使徒行传 10</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 在该撒利亚有一个人，名叫哥尼流，是意大利营的百夫长。 There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 他是个虔诚人，他和全家都敬畏　神，多多周济百姓，常常祷告　神。 A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 有一天，约在申初，他在异象中明明看见　神的一个使者进去，到他那里，说：“哥尼流。” He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 哥尼流定睛看他，惊怕说：“主啊！什么事呢？”天使说：“你的祷告和你的周济，达到　神面前，已蒙记念了。 And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 现在你当打发人往约帕去，请那称呼彼得的西门来。 And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他住在海边一个硝皮匠西门的家里；房子在海边上。” He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 向他说话的天使去后，哥尼流叫了两个家人和常伺候他的一个虔诚兵来， And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 把这事都述说给他们听，就打发他们往约帕去。 And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 第二天，他们行路将近那城，彼得约在午正上房顶去祷告； On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 觉得饿了，想要吃，那家的人正预备饭的时候，彼得魂游象外， And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 看见天开了，有一物降下，好象一块大布，系着四角，缒在地上。 And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 里面有地上各样四足的走兽和昆虫，并天上的飞鸟。 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 又有声音向他说：“彼得，起来！宰了吃。” And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 彼得却说：“主啊，这是不可的，凡俗物和不洁净的物，我从来没有吃过。” But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 第二次有声音向他说：“　神所洁净的，你不可当作俗物。” And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 这样一连三次，那物随即收回天上去了。 This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 彼得心里正在猜疑之间，不知所看见的异象是什么意思。哥尼流所差来的人已经访问到西门的家，站在门外， Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 喊着问：“有称呼彼得的西门住在这里没有？” And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 彼得还思想那异象的时候，圣灵向他说：“有三个人来找你。 While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 起来！下去，和他们同往，不要疑惑，因为是我差他们来的。” Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 于是彼得下去见那些人，说：“我就是你们所找的人，你们来是为什么缘故？” Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 他们说：“百夫长哥尼流是个义人，敬畏　神，为犹太通国所称赞。他蒙一位圣天使指示，叫他请你到他家里去，听你的话。” And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 彼得就请他们进去，住了一宿。次日起身和他们同去，还有约帕的几个弟兄同着他去。 Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 又次日，他们进入该撒利亚，哥尼流已经请了他的亲属密友等候他们。 And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 彼得一进去，哥尼流就迎接他，俯伏在他脚前拜他。 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 彼得却拉他，说：“你起来，我也是人。” But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 彼得和他说着话进去，见有好些人在那里聚集， And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 就对他们说：“你们知道犹太人和别国的人亲近来往，本是不合例的，但　神已经指示我，无论什么人都不可看作俗而不洁净的。 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 所以我被请的时候，就不推辞而来。现在请问：“你们叫我来有什么意思呢？” Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 哥尼流说：“前四天，这个时候，我在家中守着申初的祷告，忽然有一个人穿着光明的衣裳，站在我面前， And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 说：‘哥尼流，你的祷告，已蒙垂听，你的周济达到　神面前已蒙记念了。 And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 你当打发人往约帕去，请那称呼彼得的西门来，他住在海边一个硝皮匠西门的家里。’ Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 所以我立时打发人去请你。你来了很好，现今我们都在　神面前，要听主所吩咐你的一切话。” Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 彼得就开口说：“我真看出　神是不偏待人。 Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 原来各国中，那敬畏主行义的人都为主所悦纳。 But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 　神借着耶稣基督(他是万有的主)传和平的福音，将这道赐给以色列人。 The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 这话在约翰宣传洗礼以后，从加利利起，传遍了犹太。 That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 　神怎样以圣灵和能力膏拿撒勒人耶稣，这都是你们知道的。他周流四方，行善事，医好凡被魔鬼压制的人，因为　神与他同在。 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 他在犹太人之地，并耶路撒冷所行的一切事，有我们作见证。他们竟把他挂在木头上杀了。 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 第三日，　神叫他复活，显现出来； Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 不是显现给众人看，乃是显现给　神预先所拣选为他作见证的人看，就是我们这些在他从死里复活以后，和他同吃同喝的人。 Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 他吩咐我们传道给众人，证明他是　神所立定的，要作审判活人、死人的主。 And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 众先知也为他作见证，说：‘凡信他的人，必因他的名，得蒙赦罪。’” To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 彼得还说这话的时候，圣灵降在一切听道的人身上。 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 那些奉割礼和彼得同来的信徒，见圣灵的恩赐也浇在外邦人身上，就都希奇； And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 因听见他们说方言，称赞　神为大。 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 于是彼得说：“这些人既受了圣灵，与我们一样，谁能禁止用水给他们施洗呢？” Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 就吩咐奉耶稣基督的名给他们施洗。他们又请彼得住了几天。 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_11">使徒行传 11</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 使徒和在犹太的众弟兄听说外邦人也领受了　神的道。 And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 及至彼得上了耶路撒冷，那些奉割礼的门徒和他争辩说： And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: “你进入未受割礼之人的家和他们一同吃饭了。” Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 彼得就开口把这事挨次给他们讲解，说： But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: “我在约帕城里祷告的时候，魂游象外，看见异象，有一物降下，好象一块大布，系着四角，从天缒下，直来到我跟前。 I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 我定睛观看，见内中有地上四足的牲畜和野兽、昆虫，并天上的飞鸟。 Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 我且听见有声音向我说：‘彼得，起来！宰了吃。’ And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 我说：‘主啊，这是不可的。凡俗而不洁净的物从来没有入过我的口。’ But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 第二次，有声音从天上说：‘　神所洁净的，你不可当作俗物。’ But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 这样一连三次，就都收回天上去了。 And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 正当那时，有三个人站在我们所住的房门前，是从该撒利亚差来见我的。 And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 圣灵吩咐我和他们同去，不要疑惑(或作“不要分别等类”)。同着我去的，还有这六位弟兄，我们都进了那人的家。 And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 那人就告诉我们，他如何看见一位天使站在他屋里，说：‘你打发人往约帕去，请那称呼彼得的西门来， And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他有话告诉你，可以叫你和你的全家得救。’ Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 我一开讲，圣灵便降在他们身上，正象当初降在我们身上一样。 And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 我就想起主的话说：‘约翰是用水施洗，但你们要受圣灵的洗。’ Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 　神既然给他们恩赐，象在我们信主耶稣基督的时候给了我们一样；我是谁，能拦阻　神呢？” Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 众人听见这话，就不言语了，只归荣耀与　神，说：“这样看来，　神也赐恩给外邦人，叫他们悔改得生命了。” When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 那些因司提反的事遭患难四散的门徒，直走到腓尼基和居比路并安提阿。他们不向别人讲道，只向犹太人讲。 Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 但内中有居比路和古利奈人，他们到了安提阿也向希腊人传讲主耶稣(有古卷作“也向说希腊话的犹太人传讲主耶稣”)。 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 主与他们同在，信而归主的人就很多了。 And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 这风声传到耶路撒冷教会人的耳中，他们就打发巴拿巴出去，走到安提阿为止。 Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 他到了那里，看见　神所赐的恩就欢喜，劝勉众人，立定心志，恒久靠主。 Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 这巴拿巴原是个好人，被圣灵充满，大有信心，于是有许多人归服了主。 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 他又往大数去找扫罗， Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 找着了，就带他到安提阿去。他们足有一年的工夫和教会一同聚集，教训了许多人。门徒称为基督徒，是从安提阿起首。 And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 当那些日子，有几位先知从耶路撒冷下到安提阿。 And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 内中有一位，名叫亚迦布，站起来，借着圣灵指明天下将有大饥荒；这事到革老丢年间果然有了。 And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 于是门徒定意，照各人的力量捐钱，送去供给住在犹太的弟兄。 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 他们就这样行，把捐项托巴拿巴和扫罗送到众长老那里。 Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_12">使徒行传 12</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 那时，希律王下手苦害教会中几个人， Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 用刀杀了约翰的哥哥雅各。 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 他见犹太人喜欢这事，又去捉拿彼得。那时正是除酵的日子。 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 希律拿了彼得，收在监里，交付四班兵丁看守，每班四个人，意思要在逾越节后把他提出来，当着百姓办他。 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 于是彼得被囚在监里；教会却为他切切地祷告　神。 Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 希律将要提他出来的前一夜，彼得被两条铁链锁着，睡在两个兵丁当中。看守的人也在门外看守。 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 忽然有主的一个使者站在旁边，屋里有光照耀，天使拍彼得的肋旁，拍醒了他，说：“快快起来。”那铁链就从他手上脱落下来。 And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 天使对他说：“束上带子，穿上鞋。”他就那样作。天使又说：“披上外衣，跟着我来。” And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 彼得就出来跟着他，不知道天使所作是真的，只当见了异象。 And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 过了第一层第二层监牢，就来到临街的铁门，那门自己开了。他们出来，走过一条街，天使便离开他去了。 When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 彼得醒悟过来，说：“我现在真知道主差遣他的使者，救我脱离希律的手，和犹太百姓一切所盼望的。” And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 想了一想，就往那称呼马可的约翰他母亲马利亚家去，在那里有好些人聚集祷告。 And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 彼得敲外门，有一个使女，名叫罗大，出来探听； And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 听得是彼得的声音，就欢喜的顾不得开门，跑进去告诉众人说：“彼得站在门外。” And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 他们说：“你是疯了。”使女极力地说：“真是他。”他们说：“必是他的天使。” And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 彼得不住地敲门。他们开了门，看见他，就甚惊奇。 But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 彼得摆手，不要他们作声，就告诉他们主怎样领他出监；又说：“你们把这事告诉雅各和众弟兄。”于是出去，往别处去了。 But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 到了天亮，兵丁扰乱得很，不知道彼得往哪里去了。 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 希律找他，找不着，就审问看守的人，吩咐把他们拉去杀了。后来希律离开犹太，下该撒利亚去，住在那里。 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 希律恼怒推罗、西顿的人。他们那一带地方，是从王的地土得粮，因此就托了王的内侍臣伯拉斯都的情，一心来求和。 And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 希律在所定的日子，穿上朝服，坐在位上，对他们讲论一番。 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 百姓喊着说：“这是　神的声音，不是人的声音。” And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 希律不归荣耀给　神，所以主的使者立刻罚他，他被虫所咬，气就绝了。 And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 　神的道日见兴旺，越发广传。 But the word of God grew and multiplied.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 巴拿巴和扫罗办完了他们供给的事，就从耶路撒冷回来，带着称呼马可的约翰同去。 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_13">使徒行传 13</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 在安提阿的教会中，有几位先知和教师，就是巴拿巴和称呼尼结的西面，古利奈人路求，与分封之王希律同养的马念，并扫罗。 Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 他们事奉主，禁食的时候，圣灵说：“要为我分派巴拿巴和扫罗，去作我召他们所作的工。” As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 于是禁食祷告，按手在他们头上，就打发他们去了。 And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他们既被圣灵差遣，就下到西流基，从那里坐船往居比路去。 So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 到了撒拉米，就在犹太人各会堂里传讲　神的道，也有约翰作他们的帮手。 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 经过全岛，直到帕弗，在那里遇见一个有法术、假充先知的犹太人，名叫巴耶稣。 And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 这人常和方伯士求保罗同在，士求保罗是个通达人，他请了巴拿巴和扫罗来，要听　神的道。 Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 只是那行法术的以吕马(这名翻出来就是行法术的意思)敌挡使徒，要叫方伯不信真道。 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 扫罗又名保罗，被圣灵充满，定睛看他， Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 说：“你这充满各样诡诈奸恶，魔鬼的儿子，众善的仇敌，你混乱主的正道还不止住吗？ And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 现在主的手加在你身上，你要瞎眼，暂且不见日光。”他的眼睛立刻昏蒙黑暗，四下里求人拉着手领他。 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 方伯看见所作的事，很希奇主的道，就信了。 Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 保罗和他的同人从帕弗开船，来到旁非利亚的别加，约翰就离开他们，回耶路撒冷去。 Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他们离了别加往前行，来到彼西底的安提阿，在安息日进会堂坐下。 But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 读完了律法和先知的书，管会堂的，叫人过去，对他们说：“二位兄台，若有什么劝勉众人的话，请说。” And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 保罗就站起来，举手说：“以色列人和一切敬畏　神的人，请听。 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 这以色列民的　神拣选了我们的祖宗，当民寄居埃及的时候，抬举他们，用大能的手领他们出来； The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 又在旷野容忍他们约有四十年(“容忍”或作“抚养”)。 And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 既灭了迦南地七族的人，就把那地分给他们为业。 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 此后，给他们设立士师，约有四百五十年，直到先知撒母耳的时候。 And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 后来他们求一个王，　神就将便雅悯支派中基士的儿子扫罗，给他们作王四十年。 And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 既废了扫罗，就选立大卫作他们的王，又为他作见证说：‘我寻得耶西的儿子大卫，他是合我心意的人，凡事要遵行我的旨意。’ And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 从这人的后裔中，　神已经照着所应许的，为以色列人立了一位救主，就是耶稣。 Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 在他没有出来以先，约翰向以色列众民宣讲悔改的洗礼。 When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 约翰将行尽他的程途说：‘你们以为我是谁？我不是基督；只是有一位在我以后来的，我解他脚上的鞋带也是不配的。’ And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he.

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 耶路撒冷居住的人和他们的官长，因为不认识基督，也不明白每安息日所读众先知的书，就把基督定了死罪，正应了先知的预言。 For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 虽然查不出他有当死的罪来，还是求彼拉多杀他。 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 既成就了经上指着他所记的一切话，就把他从木头上取下来，放在坟墓里。 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 论到　神叫他从死里复活，不再归于朽坏，就这样说：‘我必将所应许大卫那圣洁、可靠的恩典赐给你们。’ And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 又有一篇上说：‘你必不叫你的圣者见朽坏。’ Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 大卫在世的时候，遵行了　神的旨意，就睡了(或作“大卫按　神的旨意服事了他那一世的人，就睡了。”)，归到他祖宗那里，已见朽坏； For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 惟独　神所复活的，他并未见朽坏。 But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 所以弟兄们，你们当晓得：赦罪的道是由这人传给你们的。 Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 你们靠摩西的律法，在一切不得称义的事上信靠这人，就都得称义了。 And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 所以，你们务要小心，免得先知书上所说的临到你们。 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 主说：‘你们这轻慢的人要观看，要惊奇，要灭亡，因为在你们的时候，我行一件事，虽有人告诉你们，你们总是不信。’” Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 他们出会堂的时候，众人请他们到下安息日再讲这话给他们听。 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 散会以后，犹太人和敬虔进犹太教的人，多有跟从保罗、巴拿巴的。二人对他们讲道，劝他们务要恒久在　神的恩中。 Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 到下安息日，合城的人几乎都来聚集，要听　神的道。 And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 但犹太人看见人这样多，就满心嫉妒，硬驳保罗所说的话，并且毁谤。 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 保罗和巴拿巴放胆说：“　神的道先讲给你们原是应当的；只因你们弃绝这道，断定自己不配得永生，我们就转向外邦人去。 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 因为主曾这样吩咐我们说：‘我已经立你作外邦人的光，叫你施行救恩，直到地极。’” For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 外邦人听见这话，就欢喜了，赞美　神的道；凡预定得永生的人都信了。 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 于是主的道传遍了那一带地方。 And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 但犹太人挑唆虔敬、尊贵的妇女和城内有名望的人，逼迫保罗、巴拿巴，将他们赶出境外。 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: 二人对着众人跺下脚上的尘土，就往以哥念去了。 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">52: 门徒满心喜乐，又被圣灵充满。 And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_14">使徒行传 14</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 二人在以哥念同进犹太人的会堂，在那里讲的，叫犹太人和希腊人信的很多。 And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 但那不顺从的犹太人耸动外邦人，叫他们心里恼恨弟兄。 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 二人在那里住了多日，倚靠主放胆讲道，主借他们的手，施行神迹奇事，证明他的恩道。 Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 城里的众人就分了党，有附从犹太人的，有附从使徒的。 But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 那时，外邦人和犹太人，并他们的官长，一齐拥上来，要凌辱使徒，用石头打他们。 And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 使徒知道了，就逃往吕高尼的路司得、特庇两个城，和周围地方去。 They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 在那里传福音。 And there they preached the gospel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 路司得城里坐着一个两脚无力的人，生来是瘸腿的，从来没有走过。 And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他听保罗讲道，保罗定睛看他，见他有信心，可得痊愈， The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 就大声说：“你起来！两脚站直。”那人就跳起来，而且行走。 Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 众人看见保罗所作的事，就用吕高尼的话，大声说：“有神借着人形降临在我们中间了。” And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 于是称巴拿巴为宙斯，称保罗为希耳米，因为他说话领首。 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 有城外宙斯庙的祭司牵着牛，拿着花圈，来到门前，要同众人向使徒献祭。 Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 巴拿巴、保罗二使徒听见，就撕开衣裳，跳进众人中间，喊着说： Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: “诸君，为什么作这事呢？我们也是人，性情和你们一样。我们传福音给你们，是叫你们离弃这些虚妄，归向那创造天、地、海，和其中万物的永生　神。 And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 他在从前的世代，任凭万国各行其道； Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 然而为自己未尝不显出证据来，就如常施恩惠，从天降雨，赏赐丰年，叫你们饮食饱足，满心喜乐。” Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 二人说了这些话，仅仅地拦住众人不献祭与他们。 And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 但有些犹太人，从安提阿和以哥念来，挑唆众人，就用石头打保罗，以为他是死了，便拖到城外。 And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 门徒正围着他，他就起来，走进城去。第二天，同巴拿巴往特庇去。 Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 对那城里的人传了福音，使好些人作门徒；就回路司得、以哥念、安提阿去， And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 坚固门徒的心，劝他们恒守所信的道；又说：“我们进入　神的国，必须经历许多艰难。” Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 二人在各教会中选立了长老，又禁食祷告，就把他们交托所信的主。 And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 二人经过彼西底，来到旁非利亚。 And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 在别加讲了道，就下亚大利去， And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 从那里坐船，往安提阿去。当初他们被众人所托蒙　神之恩，要办现在所作之工，就是在这地方。 And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 到了那里，聚集了会众，就述说　神借他们所行的一切事，并　神怎样为外邦人开了信道的门。 And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 二人就在那里同门徒住了多日。 And there they abode long time with the disciples.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_15">使徒行传 15</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 有几个人从犹太下来，教训弟兄们说：“你们若不按摩西的规条受割礼，不能得救。” And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 保罗、巴拿巴与他们大大地纷争辩论；众门徒就定规，叫保罗、巴拿巴和本会中几个人，为所辩论的，上耶路撒冷去见使徒和长老。 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 于是教会送他们起行。他们经过腓尼基、撒玛利亚，随处传说外邦人归主的事，叫众弟兄都甚欢喜。 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 到了耶路撒冷，教会和使徒并长老都接待他们，他们就述说　神同他们所行的一切事。 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 惟有几个信徒是法利赛教门的人，起来说：“必须给外邦人行割礼，吩咐他们遵守摩西的律法。” But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 使徒和长老聚会商议这事。 And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 辩论已经多了，彼得就起来，说：“诸位弟兄，你们知道　神早已在你们中间拣选了我，叫外邦人从我口中得听福音之道，而且相信。 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 知道人心的　神也为他们作了见证，赐圣灵给他们，正如给我们一样； And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 又借着信洁净了他们的心，并不分他们我们。 And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 现在为什么试探　神，要把我们祖宗和我们所不能负的轭，放在门徒的颈项上呢？ Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 我们得救，乃是因主耶稣的恩，和他们一样，这是我们所信的。” But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 众人都默默无声，听巴拿巴和保罗述说　神借他们在外邦人中所行的神迹、奇事。 Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他们住了声，雅各就说：“诸位弟兄，请听我的话。 And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 方才西门述说　神当初怎样眷顾外邦人，从他们中间选取百姓归于自己的名下； Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 众先知的话也与这意思相合。 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 正如经上所写的：‘此后，我要回来，重新修造大卫倒塌的帐幕，把那破坏的，重新修造建立起来； After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 叫余剩的人，就是凡称为我名下的外邦人，都寻求主。 That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 这话是从创世以来显明这事的主说的。’ Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 所以据我的意见，不可难为那归服　神的外邦人； Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 只要写信，吩咐他们禁戒偶像的污秽和奸淫，并勒死的牲畜和血。 But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 因为从古以来，摩西的书在各城有人传讲，每逢安息日，在会堂里诵读。” For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 那时，使徒和长老并全教会定意从他们中间拣选人，差他们和保罗、巴拿巴同往安提阿去；所拣选的，就是称呼巴撒巴的犹大和西拉。这两个人在弟兄中是作首领的； Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 于是写信交付他们，内中说：“使徒和作长老的弟兄们问安提阿、叙利亚、基利家外邦众弟兄的安。 And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 我们听说，有几个人从我们这里出去，用言语搅扰你们，惑乱你们的心(有古卷在此有“你们必须受割礼，守摩西的律法。”)，其实我们并没有吩咐他们。 Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 所以我们同心定意，拣选几个人，差他们同我们所亲爱的巴拿巴和保罗往你们那里去。 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 这二人是为我主耶稣基督的名不顾性命的。 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 我们就差了犹大和西拉，他们也要亲口诉说这些事。 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 因为圣灵和我们定意不将别的重担放在你们身上，惟有几件事是不可少的， For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 就是禁戒祭偶像的物和血，并勒死的牲畜和奸淫。这几件你们若能自己禁戒不犯就好了。愿你们平安。” That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 他们既奉了差遣，就下安提阿去，聚集众人，交付书信。 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 众人念了，因为信上安慰的话就欢喜了。 Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 犹大和西拉也是先知，就用许多话劝勉弟兄，坚固他们。 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 住了些日子，弟兄们打发他们平平安安地回到差遣他们的人那里去。(有古卷在此有 And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: “惟有西拉定意仍住在那里。”) Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 但保罗和巴拿巴仍住在安提阿，和许多别人一同教训人，传主的道。 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 过了些日子，保罗对巴拿巴说：“我们可以回到从前宣传主道的各城，看望弟兄们景况如何。” And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 巴拿巴有意要带称呼马可的约翰同去； And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 但保罗因为马可从前在旁非利亚离开他们，不和他们同去作工，就以为不可带他去。 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 于是二人起了争论，甚至彼此分开。巴拿巴带着马可，坐船往居比路去； And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 保罗拣选了西拉，也出去，蒙弟兄们把他交于主的恩中。 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 他就走遍叙利亚、基利家，坚固众教会。 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_16">使徒行传 16</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 保罗来到特庇，又到路司得。在那里有一个门徒，名叫提摩太，是信主之犹太妇人的儿子，他父亲却是希腊人。 Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 路司得和以哥念的弟兄都称赞他。 Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 保罗要带他同去，只因那些地方的犹太人都知道他父亲是希腊人，就给他行了割礼。 Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他们经过各城，把耶路撒冷使徒和长老所定的条规交给门徒遵守。 And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 于是众教会信心越发坚固，人数天天加增。 And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 圣灵既然禁止他们在亚细亚讲道，他们就经过弗吕家、加拉太一带地方。 Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 到了每西亚的边界，他们想要往庇推尼去，耶稣的灵却不许。 After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 他们就越过每西亚，下到特罗亚去。 And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 在夜间有异象现与保罗。有一个马其顿人站着求他说：“请你过到马其顿来帮助我们。” And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 保罗既看见这异象，我们随即想要往马其顿去，以为　神召我们传福音给那里的人听。 And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 于是从特罗亚开船，一直行到撒摩特喇，第二天到了尼亚波利。 Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 从那里来到腓立比，就是马其顿这一方的头一个城，也是罗马的驻防城。我们在这城里住了几天。 And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 当安息日，我们出城门，到了河边，知道那里有一个祷告的地方，我们就坐下对那聚会的妇女讲道。 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 有一个卖紫色布匹的妇人，名叫吕底亚，是推雅推喇城的人，素来敬拜　神。她听见了，主就开导她的心，叫她留心听保罗所讲的话。 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 她和她一家既领了洗，便求我们说：“你们若以为我是真信主的(或作“你们若以为我是忠心事主的”)，请到我家里来住；”于是强留我们。 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 后来，我们往那祷告的地方去。有一个使女迎着面来，她被巫鬼所附，用法术，叫她主人们大得财利。 And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 她跟随保罗和我们，喊着说：“这些人是至高　神的仆人，对你们传说救人的道。” The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 她一连多日这样喊叫，保罗就心中厌烦，转身对那鬼说：“我奉耶稣基督的名，吩咐你从她身上出来！”那鬼当时就出来了。 And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 使女的主人们，见得利的指望没有了，便揪住保罗和西拉，拉他们到市上去见首领； And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 又带到官长面前说：“这些人原是犹太人，竟骚扰我们的城， And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 传我们罗马人所不可受不可行的规矩。” And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 众人就一同起来攻击他们。官长吩咐剥了他们的衣裳，用棍打； And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 打了许多棍，便将他们下在监里，嘱咐禁卒严紧看守。 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 禁卒领了这样的命，就把他们下在内监里，两脚上了木狗。 Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 约在半夜，保罗和西拉祷告，唱诗赞美　神；众囚犯也侧耳而听。 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 忽然地大震动，甚至监牢的地基都摇动了，监门立刻全开，众囚犯的锁链也都松开了。 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 禁卒一醒，看见监门全开，以为囚犯已经逃走，就拔刀要自杀。 And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 保罗大声呼叫说：“不要伤害自己！我们都在这里。” But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 禁卒叫人拿灯来，就跳进去，战战兢兢地俯伏在保罗、西拉面前； Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 又领他们出来，说：“二位先生，我当怎样行才可以得救？” And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 他们说：“当信主耶稣，你和你一家都必得救。” And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 他们就把主的道讲给他和他全家的人听。 And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 当夜，就在那时候，禁卒把他们带去，洗他们的伤；他和属乎他的人立时都受了洗。 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 于是禁卒领他们上自己家里去，给他们摆上饭。他和全家，因为信了　神，都很喜乐。 And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 到了天亮，官长打发差役来，说：“释放那两个人吧。” And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 禁卒就把这话告诉保罗说：“官长打发人来叫释放你们，如今可以出监，平平安安地去吧。” And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 保罗却说：“我们是罗马人，并没有定罪，他们就在众人面前打了我们，又把我们下在监里；现在要私下撵我们出去吗？这是不行的。叫他们自己来领我们出去吧！” But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 差役把这话回禀官长；官长听见他们是罗马人，就害怕了； And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 于是来劝他们，领他们出来，请他们离开那城。 And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 二人出了监，往吕底亚家里去，见了弟兄们，劝慰他们一番，就走了。 And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_17">使徒行传 17</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 保罗和西拉经过暗妃波里、亚波罗尼亚，来到帖撒罗尼迦，在那里有犹太人的会堂。 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 保罗照他素常的规矩进去，一连三个安息日，本着圣经与他们辩论， And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 讲解陈明基督必须受害，从死里复活；又说：“我所传与你们的这位耶稣，就是基督。” Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他们中间有些人听了劝，就附从保罗和西拉，并有许多虔敬的希腊人，尊贵的妇女也不少。 And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 但那不信的犹太人心里嫉妒，招聚了些市井匪类，搭伙成群，耸动合城的人闯进耶孙的家，要将保罗、西拉带到百姓那里。 But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 找不着他们，就把耶孙和几个弟兄拉到地方官那里，喊叫说：“那搅乱天下的，也到这里来了； And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 耶孙收留他们。这些人都违背凯撒的命令，说另有一个王耶稣。” Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 众人和地方官听见这话，就惊慌了； And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 于是取了耶孙和其余之人的保状，就释放了他们。 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 弟兄们随即在夜间打发保罗和西拉往庇哩亚去。二人到了，就进入犹太人的会堂。 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 这地方的人贤于帖撒罗尼迦的人，甘心领受这道，天天考查圣经，要晓得这道是与不是。 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 所以他们中间多有相信的，又有希腊尊贵的妇女，男子也不少。 Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 但帖撒罗尼迦的犹太人知道保罗又在庇哩亚传　神的道，也就往那里去，耸动搅扰众人。 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 当时弟兄们便打发保罗往海边去；西拉和提摩太仍住在庇哩亚。 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 送保罗的人带他到了雅典，既领了保罗的命，叫西拉和提摩太速速到他这里来，就回去了。 And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 保罗在雅典等候他们的时候，看见满城都是偶像，就心里着急； Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 于是在会堂里，与犹太人和虔敬的人，并每日在市上所遇见的人辩论。 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 还有以彼古罗和斯多亚两门的学士，与他争论。有的说：“这胡言乱语的，要说什么？”有的说：“他似乎是传说外邦鬼神的。”这话是因保罗传讲耶稣与复活的道。 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他们就把他带到亚略巴古说：“你所讲的这新道，我们也可以知道吗？ And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 因为你有些奇怪的事传到我们耳中，我们愿意知道这些事是什么意思。” For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: (雅典人和住在那里的客人，都不顾别的事，只将新闻说说听听。) (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 保罗站在亚略巴古当中，说：“众位雅典人哪！我看你们凡事很敬畏鬼神。 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 我游行的时候，观看你们所敬拜的，遇见一座坛，上面写着‘未识之神’。你们所不认识而敬拜的，我现在告诉你们： For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 创造宇宙和其中万物的　神，既是天地的主，就不住人手所造的殿， God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 也不用人手服事，好象缺少什么；自己倒将生命、气息、万物，赐给万人。 Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 他从一本造出万族的人(“本”有古卷作“血脉”)，住在全地上，并且预先定准他们的年限和所住的疆界， And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 要叫他们寻求　神，或者可以揣摩而得，其实他离我们各人不远； That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 我们生活、动作、存留，都在乎他。就如你们作诗的，有人说：‘我们也是他所生的。’ For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 我们既是　神所生的，就不当以为　神的神性象人用手艺、心思所雕刻的金、银、石。 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 世人蒙昧无知的时候，　神并不监察，如今却吩咐各处的人都要悔改。 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 因为他已经定了日子，要借着他所设立的人按公义审判天下，并且叫他从死里复活，给万人作可信的凭据。” Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 众人听见从死里复活的话，就有讥诮他的；又有人说：“我们再听你讲这个吧！” And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 于是保罗从他们当中出去了。 So Paul departed from among them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 但有几个人贴近他，信了主，其中有亚略巴古的官丢尼修，并一个妇人，名叫大马哩，还有别人一同信从。 Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_18">使徒行传 18</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 这事以后，保罗离了雅典，来到哥林多。 After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 遇见一个犹太人，名叫亚居拉，他生在本都；因为革老丢命犹太人都离开罗马，新近带着妻百基拉，从意大利来。保罗就投奔了他们。 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 他们本是制造帐棚为业。保罗因与他们同业，就和他们同住作工。 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 每逢安息日，保罗在会堂里辩论，劝化犹太人和希腊人。 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 西拉和提摩太从马其顿来的时候，保罗为道迫切，向犹太人证明耶稣是基督。 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他们既抗拒、毁谤，保罗就抖着衣裳，说：“你们的罪归到你们自己头上(“罪”原文作“血”)，与我无干(原文作“我却干净”)。从今以后，我要往外邦人那里去。” And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 于是离开那里，到了一个人的家中，这人名叫提多犹士都，是敬拜　神的，他的家靠近会堂。 And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 管会堂的基利司布和全家都信了主，还有许多哥林多人听了，就相信受洗。 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 夜间，主在异象中对保罗说：“不要怕，只管讲，不要闭口； Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 有我与你同在，必没有人下手害你，因为在这城里我有许多的百姓。” For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 保罗在那里住了一年零六个月，将　神的道教训他们。 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 到迦流作亚该亚方伯的时候，犹太人同心起来攻击保罗，拉他到公堂， And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 说：“这个人劝人不按着律法敬拜　神。” Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 保罗刚要开口，迦流就对犹太人说：“你们这些犹太人！如果是为冤枉，或奸恶的事，我理当耐性听你们。 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 但所争论的，若是关乎言语、名目，和你们的律法，你们自己去办吧！这样的事我不愿意审问。” But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 就把他们撵出公堂。 And he drave them from the judgment seat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 众人便揪住管会堂的所提尼，在堂前打他。这些事迦流都不管。 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 保罗又住了多日，就辞别了弟兄，坐船往叙利亚去。百基拉、亚居拉和他同去。他因为许过愿，就在坚革哩剪了头发。 And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 到了以弗所，保罗就把他们留在那里，自己进了会堂，和犹太人辩论。 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 众人请他多住些日子，他却不允， When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 就辞别他们，说：“　神若许我，我还要回到你们这里。”于是开船离了以弗所。 But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 在该撒利亚下了船，就上耶路撒冷去问教会安，随后下安提阿去。 And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 住了些日子，又离开那里，挨次经过加拉太和弗吕家地方，坚固众门徒。 And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 有一个犹太人，名叫亚波罗，来到以弗所。他生在亚力山太，是有学问的，最能讲解圣经(“学问”或作“口才”)。 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 这人已经在主的道上受了教训，心里火热，将耶稣的事详细讲论教训人；只是他单晓得约翰的洗礼。 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 他在会堂里放胆讲道，百基拉、亚居拉听见，就接他来，将　神的道给他讲解更加详细。 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 他想要往亚该亚去，弟兄们就勉励他，并写信请门徒接待他(或作“弟兄们就写信劝门徒接待他”)，他到了那里，多帮助那蒙恩信主的人， And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 在众人面前极有能力，驳倒犹太人，引圣经证明耶稣是基督。 For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_19">使徒行传 19</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 亚波罗在哥林多的时候，保罗经过了上边一带地方，就来到以弗所；在那里遇见几个门徒， And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 问他们说：“你们信的时候，受了圣灵没有？”他们回答说：“没有，也未曾听见有圣灵赐下来。” He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 保罗说：“这样，你们受的是什么洗呢？”他们说：“是约翰的洗。” And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 保罗说：“约翰所行的是悔改的洗，告诉百姓，当信那在他以后要来的，就是耶稣。” Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他们听见这话，就奉主耶稣的名受洗。 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 保罗按手在他们头上，圣灵便降在他们身上，他们就说方言，又说预言(或作“又讲道”)。 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 一共约有十二个人。 And all the men were about twelve.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 保罗进会堂，放胆讲道，一连三个月，辩论　神国的事，劝化众人。 And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 后来，有些人心里刚硬不信，在众人面前毁谤这道，保罗就离开他们，也叫门徒与他们分离，便在推喇奴的学房，天天辩论。 But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 这样有两年之久，叫一切住在亚细亚的，无论是犹太人，是希腊人，都听见主的道。 And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 　神借保罗的手行了些非常的奇事； And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 甚至有人从保罗身上拿手巾或围裙，放在病人身上，病就退了，恶鬼也出去了。 So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 那时，有几个游行各处，念咒赶鬼的犹太人，向那被恶鬼附的人擅自称主耶稣的名，说：“我奉保罗所传的耶稣，敕令你们出来！” Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 作这事的，有犹太祭司长士基瓦的七个儿子。 And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 恶鬼回答他们说：“耶稣我认识，保罗我也知道；你们却是谁呢？” And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 恶鬼所附的人就跳在他们身上，胜了其中二人，制伏他们，叫他们赤着身子受了伤，从那房子里逃出去了。 And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 凡住在以弗所的，无论是犹太人，是希腊人，都知道这事，也都惧怕；主耶稣的名从此就尊大了。 And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 那已经信的，多有人来承认诉说自己所行的事。 And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 平素行邪术的，也有许多人把书拿来，堆积在众人面前焚烧。他们算计书价，便知道共合五万块钱。 Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 主的道大大兴旺，而且得胜，就是这样。 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 这些事完了，保罗心里定意，经过了马其顿、亚该亚，就往耶路撒冷去。又说：“我到了那里以后，也必须往罗马去看看。” After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 于是从帮助他的人中，打发提摩太、以拉都二人往马其顿去；自己暂时等在亚细亚。 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 那时，因为这道起的扰乱不小。 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 有一个银匠，名叫底米丢，是制造亚底米神银龛的，他使这样手艺人生意发达。 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 他聚集他们和同行的工人，说：“众位，你们知道我们是倚靠这生意发财。 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 这保罗不但在以弗所，也几乎在亚细亚全地，引诱迷惑许多人，说：‘人手所作的，不是神。’这是你们所看见所听见的。 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 这样，不独我们这事业被人藐视，就是大女神亚底米的庙也要被人轻忽，连亚细亚全地和普天下所敬拜的大女神之威荣也要消灭了。” So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 众人听见，就怒气填胸，喊着说：“大哉！以弗所人的亚底米啊。” And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 满城都轰动起来。众人拿住与保罗同行的马其顿人该犹和亚里达古，齐心拥进戏园里去。 And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 保罗想要进去，到百姓那里，门徒却不许他去。 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 还有亚细亚几位首领，是保罗的朋友，打发人来劝他，不要冒险到戏园里去。 And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 聚集的人纷纷乱乱：有喊叫这个的，有喊叫那个的，大半不知道是为什么聚集。 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 有人把亚历山大从众人中带出来，犹太人推他往前，亚历山大就摆手，要向百姓分诉； And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 只因他们认出他是犹太人，就大家同声喊着说：“大哉！以弗所人的亚底米啊。”如此约有两小时。 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 那城里的书记安抚了众人，就说：“以弗所人哪！谁不知道以弗所人的城，是看守大亚底米的庙，和从宙斯那里落下来的像呢？ And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 这事既是驳不倒的，你们就当安静，不可造次。 Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 你们把这些人带来，他们并没有偷窃庙中之物，也没有谤讟我们的女神。 For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 若是底米丢和他同行的人有控告人的事，自有放告的日子(或作“自有公堂”)，也有方伯可以彼此对告。 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 你们若问别的事，就可以照常例聚集断定。 But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 今日的扰乱，本是无缘无故，我们难免被查问。论到这样聚众，我们也说不出所以然来。” For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 说了这话，便叫众人散去。 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_20">使徒行传 20</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 乱定之后，保罗请门徒来，劝勉他们，就辞别起行，往马其顿去。 And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 走遍了那一带地方，用许多话劝勉门徒(或作“众人”)，然后来到希腊。 And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 在那里住了三个月，将要坐船往叙利亚去，犹太人设计要害他，他就定意从马其顿回去。 And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 同他到亚细亚去的，有庇哩亚人毕罗斯的儿子所巴特，帖撒罗尼迦人亚里达古和西公都，还有特庇人该犹，并提摩太，又有亚细亚人推基古和特罗非摩。 And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 这些人先走，在特罗亚等候我们。 These going before tarried for us at Troas.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 过了除酵的日子，我们从腓立比开船，五天到了特罗亚，和他们相会，在那里住了七天。 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 七日的第一日，我们聚会掰饼的时候，保罗因为要次日起行，就与他们讲论，直讲到半夜。 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 我们聚会的那座楼上，有好些灯烛。 And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 有一个少年人，名叫犹推古，坐在窗台上，困倦沉睡。保罗讲了多时，少年人睡熟了，就从三层楼上掉下去；扶起他来，已经死了。 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 保罗下去，伏在他身上，抱着他，说：“你们不要发慌，他的灵魂还在身上。” And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 保罗又上去，掰饼，吃了，谈论许久，直到天亮，这才走了。 When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 有人把那童子活活地领来，得的安慰不小。 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我们先上船开往亚朔去，意思要在那里接保罗；因为他是这样安排的，他自己打算要步行。 And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他既在亚朔与我们相会，我们就接他上船，来到米推利尼。 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 从那里开船，次日到了基阿的对面；又次日，在撒摩靠岸；又次日，来到米利都； And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 乃因保罗早已定意越过以弗所，免得在亚细亚耽延，他急忙前走，巴不得赶五旬节能到耶路撒冷。 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 保罗从米利都打发人往以弗所去，请教会的长老来。 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 他们来了，保罗就说：“你们知道，自从我到亚细亚的日子以来，在你们中间始终为人如何， And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 服事主，凡事谦卑，眼中流泪，又因犹太人的谋害，经历试炼。 Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 你们也知道，凡与你们有益的，我没有一样避讳不说的；或在众人面前，或在各人家里，我都教导你们； And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 又对犹太人和希腊人证明当向　神悔改，信靠我主耶稣基督。 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 现在我往耶路撒冷去，心甚迫切(原文作“心被捆绑”)，不知道在那里要遇见什么事； And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 但知道圣灵在各城里向我指证，说有捆锁与患难等待我。 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 我却不以性命为念，也不看为宝贵，只要行完我的路程，成就我从主耶稣所领受的职事，证明　神恩惠的福音。 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: “我素常在你们中间来往，传讲　神国的道；如今我晓得，你们以后都不得再见我的面了。 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 所以我今日向你们证明，你们中间无论何人死亡，罪不在我身上(原文作“我于众人的血是洁净的”)。 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 因为　神的旨意，我并没有一样避讳不传给你们的。 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 圣灵立你们作全群的监督，你们就当为自己谨慎，也为全群谨慎，牧养　神的教会，就是他用自己血所买来的(或作“救赎的”)。 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 我知道我去之后，必有凶暴的豺狼进入你们中间，不爱惜羊群。 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 就是你们中间，也必有人起来，说悖谬的话，要引诱门徒跟从他们。 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 所以你们应当警醒，记念我三年之久，昼夜不住地流泪，劝戒你们各人。 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 如今我把你们交托　神和他恩惠的道；这道能建立你们，叫你们和一切成圣的人同得基业。 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 我未曾贪图一个人的金、银、衣服。 I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 我这两只手常供给我和同人的需用，这是你们自己知道的。 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 我凡事给你们作榜样，叫你们知道，应当这样劳苦，扶助软弱的人，又当记念主耶稣的话，说：‘施比受更为有福。’” I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 保罗说完了这话，就跪下同众人祷告。 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 众人痛哭，抱着保罗的颈项，和他亲嘴。 And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 叫他们最伤心的，就是他说：“以后不能再见我的面”那句话，于是送他上船去了。 Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_21">使徒行传 21</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 我们离别了众人，就开船一直行到哥士。第二天到了罗底，从那里到帕大喇， And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 遇见一只船要往腓尼基去，就上船起行。 And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 望见居比路，就从南边行过，往叙利亚去，我们就在推罗上岸，因为船要在那里卸货。 Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 找着了门徒，就在那里住了七天。他们被圣灵感动，对保罗说：“不要上耶路撒冷去。” And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 过了这几天，我们就起身前行。他们众人同妻子儿女，送我们到城外，我们都跪在岸上祷告，彼此辞别。 And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 我们上了船，他们就回家去了。 And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 我们从推罗行尽了水路，来到多利买，就问那里的弟兄安，和他们同住了一天。 And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 第二天，我们离开那里，来到该撒利亚，就进了传福音的腓利家里，和他同住；他是那七个执事里的一个。 And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他有四个女儿，都是处女，是说预言的。 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 我们在那里多住了几天，有一个先知，名叫亚迦布，从犹太下来， And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 到了我们这里，就拿保罗的腰带捆上自己的手脚，说：“圣灵说：犹太人在耶路撒冷，要如此捆绑这腰带的主人，把他交在外邦人手里。” And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 我们和那本地的人听见这话，都苦劝保罗不要上耶路撒冷去。 And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 保罗说：“你们为什么这样痛哭，使我心碎呢？我为主耶稣的名，不但被人捆绑，就是死在耶路撒冷也是愿意的。” Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 保罗既不听劝，我们便住了口，只说：“愿主的旨意成就，”便了。 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 过了几日，我们收拾行李上耶路撒冷去。 And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 有该撒利亚的几个门徒和我们同去，带我们到一个久为(“久为”或作“老”)门徒的家里，叫我们与他同住；他名叫拿孙，是居比路人。 There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 到了耶路撒冷，弟兄们欢欢喜喜地接待我们。 And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 第二天，保罗同我们去见雅各，长老们也都在那里。 And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 保罗问了他们安，便将　神用他传教，在外邦人中间所行之事，一一地述说了。 And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 他们听见，就归荣耀与　神，对保罗说：“兄台，你看犹太人中信主的有多少万，并且都为律法热心。 And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 他们听见人说，你教训一切在外邦的犹太人离弃摩西，对他们说，不要给孩子行割礼，也不要遵行条规。 And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 众人必听见你来了，这可怎么办呢？ What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 你就照着我们的话行吧！我们这里有四个人，都有愿在身。 Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 你带他们去，与他们一同行洁净的礼，替他们拿出规费，叫他们得以剃头。这样，众人就可知道，先前所听见你的事都是虚的；并可知道，你自己为人，循规蹈矩，遵行律法。 Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 至于信主的外邦人，我们已经写信拟定，叫他们谨忌那祭偶像之物，和血，并勒死的牲畜，与奸淫。” As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 于是保罗带着那四个人，第二天与他们一同行了洁净的礼，进了殿，报明洁净的日期满足，只等祭司为他们各人献祭。 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 那七日将完，从亚细亚来的犹太人看见保罗在殿里，就耸动了众人，下手拿他， And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 喊叫说：“以色列人来帮助，这就是在各处教训众人糟践我们百姓和律法，并这地方的。他又带着希腊人进殿，污秽了这圣地。” Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 这话是因他们曾看见以弗所人特罗非摩，同保罗在城里，以为保罗带他进了殿。 (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 合城都震动，百姓一齐跑来，拿住保罗，拉他出殿，殿门立刻都关了。 And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 他们正想要杀他，有人报信给营里的千夫长说：“耶路撒冷合城都乱了。” And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 千夫长立时带着兵丁和几个百夫长，跑下去到他们那里。他们见了千夫长和兵丁，就止住不打保罗。 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 于是千夫长上前拿住他，吩咐用两条铁链捆锁；又问他是什么人，作的是什么事。 Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 众人有喊叫这个的，有喊叫那个的；千夫长因为这样乱嚷，得不着实情，就吩咐人将保罗带进营楼去。 And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 到了台阶上，众人挤得凶猛，兵丁只得将保罗抬起来。 And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 众人跟在后面，喊着说：“除掉他！” For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 将要带他进营楼，保罗对千夫长说：“我对你说句话可以不可以？”他说：“你懂得希腊话吗？ And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 你莫非是从前作乱，带领四千凶徒往旷野去的那埃及人吗？” Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 保罗说：“我本是犹太人，生在基利家的大数，并不是无名小城的人。求你准我对百姓说话。” But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 千夫长准了。保罗就站在台阶上，向百姓摆手，他们都静默无声，保罗便用希伯来话对他们说： And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_22">使徒行传 22</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: “诸位父兄请听，我现在对你们分诉。” Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 众人听他说的是希伯来话，就更加安静了。 (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 保罗说：“我原是犹太人，生在基利家的大数，长在这城里，在迦玛列门下，按着我们祖宗严紧的律法受教，热心事奉　神，象你们众人今日一样。 I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 我也曾逼迫奉这道的人，直到死地，无论男女都锁拿下监。 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 这是大祭司和众长老都可以给我作见证的。我又领了他们达与弟兄的书信，往大马色去，要把在那里奉这道的人锁拿，带到耶路撒冷受刑。 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 我将到大马色，正走的时候，约在晌午，忽然从天上发大光，四面照着我。 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 我就仆倒在地，听见有声音对我说：‘扫罗！扫罗！你为什么逼迫我？’ And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 我回答说：‘主啊！你是谁？”他说：‘我就是你所逼迫的拿撒勒人耶稣。’ And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 与我同行的人看见了那光，却没有听明那位对我说话的声音。 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 我说：‘主啊，我当作什么？”主说：‘起来，进大马色去，在那里，要将所派你作的一切事告诉你。’ And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 我因那光的荣耀不能看见，同行的人就拉着我手进了大马色。 And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 那里有一个人，名叫亚拿尼亚，按着律法是虔诚人，为一切住在那里的犹太人所称赞。 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他来见我，站在旁边，对我说：‘兄弟扫罗，你可以看见。’我当时往上一看，就看见了他。 Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他又说：‘我们祖宗的　神拣选了你，叫你明白他的旨意，又得见那义者，听他口中所出的声音。 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 因为你要将所看见的，所听见的，对着万人为他作见证。 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 现在你为什么耽延呢？起来，求告他的名受洗，洗去你的罪。’ And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 后来我回到耶路撒冷，在殿里祷告的时候，魂游象外， And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 看见主向我说：‘你赶紧地离开耶路撒冷，不可迟延；因你为我作的见证，这里的人，必不领受。’ And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 我就说：‘主啊！他们知道我从前把信你的人收在监里，又在各会堂里鞭打他们。 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 并且你的见证人司提反被害流血的时候，我也站在旁边欢喜；又看守害死他之人的衣裳。’ And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 主向我说：‘你去吧！我要差你远远地往外邦人那里去。’” And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 众人听他说到这句话，就高声说：“这样的人，从世上除掉他吧！他是不当活着的。” And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 众人喧嚷，摔掉衣裳，把尘土向空中扬起来。 And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 千夫长就吩咐将保罗带进营楼去，叫人用鞭子拷问他，要知道他们向他这样喧嚷是为什么缘故。 The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 刚用皮条捆上，保罗对旁边站着的百夫长说：“人是罗马人，又没有定罪，你们就鞭打他，有这个例吗？” And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 百夫长听见这话，就去见千夫长，告诉他说：“你要作什么？这人是罗马人。” When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 千夫长就来问保罗说：“你告诉我，你是罗马人吗？”保罗说：“是。” Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 千夫长说：“我用许多银子，才入了罗马的民籍。”保罗说：“我生来就是。” And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 于是那些要拷问保罗的人就离开他去了。千夫长既知道他是罗马人，又因为捆绑了他，也害怕了。 Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 第二天，千夫长为要知道犹太人控告保罗的实情，便解开他，吩咐祭司长和全公会的人都聚集，将保罗带下来，叫他站在他们面前。 On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_23">使徒行传 23</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 保罗定睛看着公会的人，说：“弟兄们！我在　神面前，行事为人都是凭着良心，直到今日。” And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 大祭司亚拿尼亚就吩咐旁边站着的人打他的嘴。 And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 保罗对他说：“你这粉饰的墙，　神要打你！你坐堂为的是按律法审问我，你竟违背律法，吩咐人打我吗？” Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 站在旁边的人说：“你辱骂　神的大祭司吗？” And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 保罗说：“弟兄们，我不晓得他是大祭司。经上记着说：‘不可毁谤你百姓的官长。’” Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 保罗看出大众一半是撒都该人，一半是法利赛人，就在公会中大声说：“弟兄们！我是法利赛人，也是法利赛人的子孙。我现在受审问，是为盼望死人复活。” But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 说了这话，法利赛人和撒都该人就争论起来，会众分为两党。 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 因为撒都该人说，没有复活，也没有天使和鬼魂；法利赛人却说，两样都有。 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 于是大大地喧嚷起来。有几个法利赛党的文士站起来争辩说：“我们看不出这人有什么恶处，倘若有鬼魂或是天使对他说过话，怎么样呢？” And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 那时大起争吵，千夫长恐怕保罗被他们扯碎了，就吩咐兵丁下去，把他从众人当中抢出来，带进营楼去。 And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 当夜，主站在保罗旁边，说：“放心吧！你怎样在耶路撒冷为我作见证，也必怎样在罗马为我作见证。” And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 到了天亮，犹太人同谋起誓，说：“若不先杀保罗，就不吃不喝。” And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 这样同心起誓的，有四十多人。 And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他们来见祭司长和长老，说：“我们已经起了一个大誓，若不先杀保罗，就不吃什么。 And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 现在你们和公会要知会千夫长，叫他带下保罗到你们这里来，假作要详细察考他的事；我们已经预备好了，不等他来到跟前就杀他。” Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 保罗的外甥听见他们设下埋伏，就来到营楼里告诉保罗。 And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 保罗请一个百夫长来，说：“你领这少年人去见千夫长，他有事告诉他。” Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 于是把他领去见千夫长，说：“被囚的保罗请我到他那里，求我领这少年人来见你；他有事告诉你。” So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 千夫长就拉着他的手，走到一旁，私下问他说：“你有什么事告诉我呢？” Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 他说：“犹太人已经约定，要求你明天带下保罗到公会里去，假作要详细查问他的事。 And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 你切不要随从他们，因为他们有四十多人埋伏，已经起誓说，若不先杀保罗，就不吃不喝。现在预备好了，只等你应允。” But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 于是千夫长打发少年人走，嘱咐他说：“不要告诉人你将这事报给我了。” So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 千夫长便叫了两个百夫长来，说：“预备步兵二百，马兵七十，长枪手二百，今夜亥初往该撒利亚去； And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 也要预备牲口叫保罗骑上，护送到巡抚腓力斯那里去。” And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 千夫长又写了文书， And he wrote a letter after this manner:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 大略说：“革老丢吕西亚，请巡抚腓力斯大人安。 Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 这人被犹太人拿住，将要杀害，我得知他是罗马人，就带兵丁下去救他出来。 This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 因要知道他们告他的缘故，我就带他下到他们的公会去； And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 便查知他被告是因他们律法的辩论，并没有什么该死该绑的罪名。 Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 后来有人把要害他的计谋告诉我，我就立时解他到你那里去，又吩咐告他的人在你面前告他(有古卷在此有“愿你平安”)。” And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 于是兵丁照所吩咐他们的，将保罗夜里带到安提帕底。 Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 第二天，让马兵护送，他们就回营楼去。 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 马兵来到该撒利亚，把文书呈给巡抚，便叫保罗站在他面前。 Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 巡抚看了文书，问保罗是哪省的人；既晓得他是基利家人， And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 就说：“等告你的人来到，我要细听你的事，”便吩咐人把他看守在希律的衙门里。 I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_24">使徒行传 24</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 过了五天，大祭司亚拿尼亚同几个长老和一个辩士帖土罗下来，向巡抚控告保罗。 And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 保罗被提了来，帖土罗就告他说： And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: “腓力斯大人，我们因你得以大享太平，并且这一国的弊病，因着你的先见得以更正了；我们随时随地满心感谢不尽。 We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 惟恐多说：你嫌烦絮，只求你宽容听我们说几句话。 Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 我们看这个人，如同瘟疫一般，是鼓动普天下众犹太人生乱的，又是拿撒勒教党里的一个头目， For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 连圣殿他也想要污秽；我们把他捉住了(有古卷在此有“要按我们的律法审问， Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 不料千夫长吕西亚前来，甚是强横，从我们手中把他夺去，吩咐告他的人到你这里来。”)。 But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 你自己究问他，就可以知道我们告他的一切事了。” Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 众犹太人也随着告他说：“事情诚然是这样。” And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 巡抚点头叫保罗说话。他就说：“我知道你在这国里断事多年，所以我乐意为自己分诉。 Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 你查问就可以知道，从我上耶路撒冷礼拜到今日，不过有十二天。 Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他们并没有看见我在殿里，或是在会堂里，或是在城里，和人辩论，耸动众人。 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他们现在所告我的事并不能对你证实了。 Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 但有一件事，我向你承认，就是他们所称为异端的道，我正按着那道事奉我祖宗的　神，又信合乎律法的，和先知书上一切所记载的； But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 并且靠着　神，盼望死人，无论善恶，都要复活，就是他们自己也有这个盼望。 And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 我因此自己勉励，对　神对人，常存无亏的良心。 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 过了几年，我带着周济本国的捐项和供献的物上去。 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 正献的时候，他们看见我在殿里已经洁净了，并没有聚众，也没有吵嚷，惟有几个从亚细亚来的犹太人。 Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他们若有告我的事，就应当到你面前来告我。 Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 即或不然，这些人若看出我站在公会前，有妄为的地方，他们自己也可以说明。 Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 纵然有，也不过一句话，就是我站在他们中间大声说：‘我今日在你们面前受审，是为死人复活的道理。’” Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 腓力斯本是详细晓得这道，就支吾他们说：“且等千夫长吕西亚下来，我要审断你们的事。” And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 于是吩咐百夫长看守保罗，并且宽待他，也不拦阻他的亲友来供给他。 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 过了几天，腓力斯和他夫人犹太的女子土西拉一同来到，就叫了保罗来，听他讲论信基督耶稣的道。 And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 保罗讲论公义、节制，和将来的审判。腓力斯甚觉恐惧，说：“你暂且去吧！等我得便再叫你来。” And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 腓力斯又指望保罗送他银钱，所以屡次叫他来，和他谈论。 He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 过了两年，波求非斯都接了腓力斯的任；腓力斯要讨犹太人的喜欢，就留保罗在监里。 But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_25">使徒行传 25</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 非斯都到了任，过了三天，就从该撒利亚上耶路撒冷去。 Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 祭司长和犹太人的首领向他控告保罗； Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 又央告他，求他的情，将保罗提到耶路撒冷来，他们要在路上埋伏杀害他。 And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 非斯都却回答说：“保罗押在该撒利亚，我自己快要往那里去；” But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 又说：“你们中间有权势的人与我一同下去，那人若有什么不是，就可以告他。” Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 非斯都在他们那里住了不过十天八天，就下该撒利亚去。第二天坐堂，吩咐将保罗提上来。 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 保罗来了，那些从耶路撒冷下来的犹太人，周围站着，将许多重大的事控告他，都是不能证实的。 And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 保罗分诉说：“无论犹太人的律法，或是圣殿，或是凯撒，我都没有干犯。” While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 但非斯都要讨犹太人的喜欢，就问保罗说：“你愿意上耶路撒冷去，在那里听我审断这事吗？” But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 保罗说：“我站在凯撒的堂前，这就是我应当受审的地方。我向犹太人并没有行过什么不义的事，这也是你明明知道的。 Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 我若行了不义的事，犯了什么该死的罪，就是死，我也不辞。他们所告我的事若都不实，就没有人可以把我交给他们。我要上告于凯撒。” For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 非斯都和议会商量了，就说：“你既上告于凯撒，可以往凯撒那里去。” Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 过了些日子，亚基帕王和百尼基氏来到该撒利亚，问非斯都安。 And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 在那里住了多日，非斯都将保罗的事告诉王，说：“这里有一个人，是腓力斯留在监里的。 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 我在耶路撒冷的时候，祭司长和犹太的长老将他的事禀报了我，求我定他的罪。 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 我对他们说，无论什么人，被告还没有和原告对质，未得机会分诉所告他的事，就先定他的罪，这不是罗马人的条例。 To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 及至他们都来到这里，我就不耽延，第二天便坐堂，吩咐把那人提上来。 Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 告他的人站着告他；所告的，并没有我所逆料的那等恶事。 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 不过是有几样辩论，为他们自己敬鬼神的事，又为一个人名叫耶稣，是已经死了，保罗却说他是活着的。 But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 这些事当怎样究问，我心里作难；所以问他说：‘你愿意上耶路撒冷去，在那里为这些事听审吗？’ And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 但保罗求我留下他，要听皇上审断；我就吩咐把他留下，等我解他到凯撒那里去。” But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 亚基帕对非斯都说：“我自己也愿听这人辩论。”非斯都说：“明天你可以听。” Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 第二天，亚基帕和百尼基大张威势而来，同着众千夫长和城里的尊贵人进了公厅。非斯都吩咐一声，就有人将保罗带进来。 And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 非斯都说：“亚基帕王和在这里的诸位啊！你们看这人，就是一切犹太人，在耶路撒冷和这里，曾向我恳求、呼叫说：‘不可容他再活着。’ And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 但我查明他没有犯什么该死的罪，并且他自己上告于皇帝，所以我定意把他解去。 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 论到这人，我没有确实的事可以奏明主上。因此，我带他到你们面前，也特意带他到你亚基帕王面前，为要在查问之后，有所陈奏。 Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 据我看来，解送囚犯，不指明他的罪案，是不合理的。” For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_26">使徒行传 26</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 亚基帕对保罗说：“准你为自己辩明。”于是保罗伸手分诉说： Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: “亚基帕王啊！犹太人所告我的一切事，今日得在你面前分诉，实为万幸； I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 更可幸的，是你熟悉犹太人的规矩和他们的辩论；所以求你耐心听我。 Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 我从起初在本国的民中，并在耶路撒冷，自幼为人如何，犹太人都知道。 My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他们若肯作见证，就晓得我从起初，是按着我们教中最严紧的教门，作了法利赛人。 Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 现在我站在这里受审，是因为指望　神向我们祖宗所应许的。 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 这应许，我们十二个支派，昼夜切切地事奉　神，都指望得着。王啊，我被犹太人控告，就是因这指望。 Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 　神叫死人复活，你们为什么看作不可信的呢？ Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 从前我自己以为应当多方攻击拿撒勒人耶稣的名。 I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 我在耶路撒冷也曾这样行了。既从祭司长得了权柄，我就把许多圣徒囚在监里。他们被杀，我也出名定案。 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 在各会堂，我屡次用刑强逼他们说亵渎的话；又分外恼恨他们，甚至追逼他们，直到外邦的城邑。 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: “那时，我领了祭司长的权柄和命令，往大马色去。 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 王啊！我在路上，晌午的时候，看见从天发光，比日头还亮，四面照着我并与我同行的人。 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 我们都仆倒在地，我就听见有声音用希伯来话向我说：‘扫罗！扫罗！为什么逼迫我？你用脚踢刺是难的！’ And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 我说：‘主啊，你是谁？’主说：‘我就是你所逼迫的耶稣。 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 你起来站着，我特意向你显现，要派你作执事，作见证，将你所看见的事，和我将要指示你的事，证明出来。 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 我也要救你脱离百姓和外邦人的手。 Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 我差你到他们那里去，要叫他们的眼睛得开，从黑暗中归向光明，从撒但权下归向　神；又因信我，得蒙赦罪，和一切成圣的人同得基业。’ To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: “亚基帕王啊！我故此没有违背那从天上来的异象； Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 先在大马色，后在耶路撒冷和犹太全地，以及外邦，劝勉他们应当悔改归向　神，行事与悔改的心相称。 But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 因此，犹太人在殿里拿住我，想要杀我。 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 然而我蒙　神的帮助，直到今日还站得住，对着尊贵卑贱老幼作见证；所讲的，并不外乎众先知和摩西所说，将来必成的事， Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 就是基督必须受害，并且因从死里复活，要首先把光明的道传给百姓和外邦人。” That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 保罗这样分诉，非斯都大声说：“保罗！你癫狂了吧！你的学问太大，反叫你癫狂了。” And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 保罗说：“非斯都大人，我不是癫狂，我说的乃是真实明白话。 But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 王也晓得这些事，所以我向王放胆直言，我深信这些事没有一件向王隐藏的，因都不是在背地里作的。 For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 亚基帕王啊！你信先知吗？我知道你是信的。” King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 亚基帕对保罗说：“你想少微一劝，便叫我作基督徒啊(或作“你这样劝我，几乎叫我作基督徒了。”)！” Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 保罗说：“无论是少劝，是多劝，我向　神所求的，不但你一个人，就是今天一切听我的，都要象我一样，只是不要象我有这些锁链。” And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 于是王和巡抚并百尼基与同坐的人都起来， And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 退到里面，彼此谈论说：“这人并没有犯什么该死该绑的罪。” And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 亚基帕又对非斯都说：“这人若没有上告于凯撒，就可以释放了。” Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_27">使徒行传 27</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 非斯都既然定规了，叫我们坐船往意大利去，便将保罗和别的囚犯交给御营里的一个百夫长，名叫犹流。 And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 有一只亚大米田的船要沿着亚细亚一带地方的海边走，我们就上了那船开行，有马其顿的帖撒罗尼迦人亚里达古和我们同去。 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 第二天，到了西顿，犹流宽待保罗，准他往朋友那里去，受他们的照应。 And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 从那里又开船，因为风不顺，就贴着居比路背风岸行去。 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 过了基利家、旁非利亚前面的海，就到了吕家的每拉。 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 在那里，百夫长遇见一只亚力山太的船，要往意大利去，便叫我们上了那船。 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 一连多日，船行得慢，仅仅来到革尼土的对面。因为被风拦阻，就贴着革哩底背风岸，从撒摩尼对面行过。 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 我们沿岸行走，仅仅来到一个地方，名叫佳澳；离那里不远，有拉西亚城。 And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 走的日子多了，已经过了禁食的节期，行船又危险，保罗就劝众人说： Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: “众位，我看这次行船，不但货物和船要受伤损，大遭破坏，连我们的性命也难保。” And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 但百夫长信从掌船的和船主，不信从保罗所说的。 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 且因在这海口过冬不便，船上的人就多半说，不如开船离开这地方，或者能到非尼基过冬。非尼基是革哩底的一个海口，一面朝东北，一面朝东南。 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 这时微微起了南风，他们以为得意，就起了锚，贴近革哩底行去。 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 不多几时，狂风从岛上扑下来；那风名叫友拉革罗。 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 船被风抓住，敌不住风，我们就任风刮去。 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 贴着一个小岛的背风岸奔行，那岛名叫高大，在那里仅仅收住了小船。 And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 既然把小船拉上来，就用缆索捆绑船底，又恐怕在赛耳底沙滩上搁了浅，就落下篷来，任船飘去。 Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 我们被风浪逼得甚急，第二天众人就把货物抛在海里。 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 到第三天，他们又亲手把船上的器具抛弃了。 And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 太阳和星辰多日不显露，又有狂风大浪催逼，我们得救的指望就都绝了。 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 众人多日没有吃什么，保罗就出来站在他们中间，说：“众位，你们本该听我的话，不离开革哩底，免得遭这样的伤损破坏。 But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 现在我还劝你们放心，你们的性命，一个也不失丧，惟独失丧这船。 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 因我所属所事奉的　神，他的使者昨夜站在我旁边，说： For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: ‘保罗，不要害怕，你必定站在凯撒面前，并且与你同船的人，　神都赐给你了。’ Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 所以众位可以放心，我信　神他怎样对我说，事情也要怎样成就。 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 只是我们必要撞在一个岛上。” Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 到了第十四天夜间，船在亚底亚海飘来飘去。约到半夜，水手以为渐近旱地， But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 就探深浅，探得有十二丈；稍往前行，又探深浅，探得有九丈。 And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 恐怕撞在石头上，就从船尾抛下四个锚，盼望天亮。 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 水手想要逃出船去，把小船放在海里，假作要从船头抛锚的样子。 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 保罗对百夫长和兵丁说：“这些人若不等在船上，你们必不能得救。” Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 于是兵丁砍断小船的绳子，由它飘去。 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 天渐亮的时候，保罗劝众人都吃饭，说：“你们悬望忍饿不吃什么，已经十四天了。 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 所以我劝你们吃饭，这是关乎你们救命的事；因为你们各人连一根头发也不至于损坏。” Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 保罗说了这话，就拿着饼，在众人面前祝谢了　神，掰开吃。 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 于是他们都放下心，也就吃了。 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 我们在船上的，共有二百七十六个人。 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 他们吃饱了，就把船上的麦子抛在海里，为要叫船轻一点。 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 到了天亮，他们不认识那地方，但见一个海湾，有岸可登，就商议能把船拢进去不能。 And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 于是砍断缆索，弃锚在海里；同时也松开舵绳，拉起头篷，顺着风向岸行去。 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 但遇着两水夹流的地方，就把船搁了浅；船头胶住不动，船尾被浪的猛力冲坏。 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 兵丁的意思要把囚犯杀了，恐怕有洑水脱逃的。 And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 但百夫长要救保罗，不准他们任意而行，就吩咐会洑水的，跳下水去先上岸； But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 其余的人，可以用板子，或船上的零碎东西上岸。这样，众人都得了救，上了岸。 And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor44_28">使徒行传 28</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 我们既已得救，才知道那岛名叫马耳他。 And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 土人看待我们，有非常的情分；因为当时下雨，天气又冷，就生火接待我们众人。 And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 那时，保罗拾起一捆柴，放在火上，有一条毒蛇，因为热了出来，咬住他的手。 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 土人看见那毒蛇悬在他手上，就彼此说：“这人必是个凶手，虽然从海里救上来，天理还不容他活着。” And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 保罗竟把那毒蛇甩在火里，并没有受伤。 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 土人想他必要肿起来，或是忽然仆倒死了；看了多时，见他无害，就转念说：“他是个神。” Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 离那地方不远，有田产是岛长部百流的。他接纳我们，尽情款待三日。 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 当时，部百流的父亲患热病和痢疾躺着。保罗进去，为他祷告，按手在他身上，治好了他。 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 从此，岛上其余的病人也来得了医治。 So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 他们又多方地尊敬我们；到了开船的时候，也把我们所需用的送到船上。 Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 过了三个月，我们上了亚力山太的船往前行。这船以“宙斯双子”为记，是在那海岛过了冬的。 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 到了叙拉古，我们停泊三日； And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 又从那里绕行，来到利基翁。过了一天，起了南风，第二天就来到部丢利。 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 在那里遇见弟兄们，请我们与他们同住了七天。这样，我们来到罗马。 Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 那里的弟兄们一听见我们的信息，就出来到亚比乌市和三馆地方迎接我们。保罗见了他们，就感谢　神，放心壮胆。 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 进了罗马城(有古卷在此有“百夫长把众囚犯交给御营的统领，惟有”)，保罗蒙准，和一个看守他的兵另住在一处。 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 过了三天，保罗请犹太人的首领来。他们来了，就对他们说：“弟兄们，我虽没有作什么事，干犯本国的百姓和我们祖宗的规条，却被锁绑，从耶路撒冷解在罗马人的手里。 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 他们审问了我，就愿意释放我；因为在我身上，并没有该死的罪。 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 无奈犹太人不服，我不得已，只好上告于凯撒，并非有什么事要控告我本国的百姓。 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 因此，我请你们来见面说话，我原为以色列人所指望的，被这链子捆锁。” For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 他们说：“我们并没有接着从犹太来论你的信，也没有弟兄到这里来，报给我们说，你有什么不好处。 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 但我们愿意听你的意见如何；因为这教门，我们晓得是到处被毁谤的。” But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 他们和保罗约定了日子，就有许多人到他的寓处来。保罗从早到晚，对他们讲论这事，证明　神国的道，引摩西的律法和先知的书，以耶稣的事劝勉他们。 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 他所说的话，有信的，有不信的。 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 他们彼此不合，就散了，未散以先，保罗说了一句话，说：“圣灵借先知以赛亚向你们祖宗所说的话是不错的。 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 他说：‘你去告诉这百姓说：你们听是要听见，却不明白；看是要看见，却不晓得； Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 因为这百姓油蒙了心，耳朵发沉，眼睛闭着；恐怕眼睛看见，耳朵听见，心里明白，回转过来，我就医治他们。’ For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 所以你们当知道，　神这救恩，如今传给外邦人，他们也必听受(有古卷在此有 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: “保罗说了这话，犹太人议论纷纷地就走了。”)。” And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 保罗在自己所租的房子里住了足足两年。凡来见他的人，他全都接待， And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 放胆传讲　神国的道，将主耶稣基督的事教导人，并没有人禁止。 Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</p>
