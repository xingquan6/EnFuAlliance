And the king said, What wouldest thou?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 她说：“我主啊！你曾向婢女指着耶和华你的　神起誓说：你儿子所罗门必接续我作王，坐在我的位上。 And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 现在亚多尼雅作王了，我主我王却不知道。 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他宰了许多牛羊、肥犊，请了王的众子和祭司亚比亚他，并元帅约押。惟独王的仆人所罗门，他没有请。 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 我主我王啊！以色列众人的眼目都仰望你，等你晓谕他们，在我主我王之后，谁坐你的位。 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 若不然，到我主我王与列祖同睡以后，我和我儿子所罗门，必算为罪人了。” Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 拔示巴还与王说话的时候，先知拿单也进来了。 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 有人奏告王说：“先知拿单来了。”拿单进到王前，脸伏于地。 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 拿单说：“我主我王果然应许亚多尼雅说：‘你必接续我作王，坐在我的位上’吗？ And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 他今日下去，宰了许多牛羊、肥犊，请了王的众子和军长，并祭司亚比亚他，他们正在亚多尼雅面前吃喝，说：‘愿亚多尼雅王万岁！’ For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 惟独我，就是你的仆人和祭司撒督，耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅，并王的仆人所罗门，他都没有请。 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 这事果然出乎我主我王吗？王却没有告诉仆人们，在我主我王之后，谁坐你的位。” Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 大卫王吩咐说：“叫拔示巴来。”拔示巴就进来，站在王面前。 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 王起誓说：“我指着救我性命脱离一切苦难、永生的耶和华起誓。 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 我既然指着耶和华以色列的　神向你起誓，说：‘你儿子所罗门必接续我作王，坐在我的位上。’我今日就必照这话而行。” Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 于是，拔示巴脸伏于地，向王下拜，说：“愿我主大卫王万岁！” Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 大卫王又吩咐说：“将祭司撒督，先知拿单，耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅召来！”他们就都来到王面前。 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 王对他们说：“要带领你们主的仆人，使我儿子所罗门骑我的骡子，送他下到基训， The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 在那里祭司撒督和先知拿单要膏他作以色列的王。你们也要吹角，说：‘愿所罗门王万岁！’ And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 然后要跟随他上来，使他坐在我的位上，接续我作王。我已立他作以色列和犹大的君。” Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅对王说：“阿们！愿耶和华我主我王的　神，也这样命定。 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 耶和华怎样与我主我王同在，愿他照样与所罗门同在，使他的国位比我主大卫王的国位更大！” As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 于是，祭司撒督、先知拿单、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅和基利提人、比利提人，都下去使所罗门骑大卫王的骡子，将他送到基训。 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 祭司撒督就从帐幕中取了盛膏油的角来，用膏膏所罗门。人就吹角，众民都说：“愿所罗门王万岁！” And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 众民跟随他上来，且吹笛，大大欢呼，声音震地。 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 亚多尼雅和所请的众客筵宴方毕，听见这声音，约押听见角声就说：“城中为何有这响声呢？” And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 他正说话的时候，祭司亚比亚他的儿子约拿单来了，亚多尼雅对他说：“进来吧！你是个忠义的人，必是报好信息。” And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 约拿单对亚多尼雅说：“我们的主大卫王，诚然立所罗门为王了。 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 王差遣祭司撒督、先知拿单、耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅和基利提人、比利提人，都去使所罗门骑王的骡子。 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 祭司撒督和先知拿单在基训已经膏他作王。众人都从那里欢呼着上来，声音使城震动，这就是你们所听见的声音。 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 并且所罗门登了国位。 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 王的臣仆也来为我们的主大卫王祝福，说：‘愿王的　神使所罗门的名比王的名更尊荣！使他的国位比王的国位更大！’王就在床上屈身下拜。 And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 王又说：‘耶和华以色列的　神是应当称颂的，因他赐我一人今日坐在我的位上，我也亲眼看见了！’” And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 亚多尼雅的众客听见这话，就都惊惧，起来四散。 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 亚多尼雅惧怕所罗门，就起来去抓住祭坛的角。 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: 有人告诉所罗门说：“亚多尼雅惧怕所罗门王，现在抓住祭坛的角，说：‘愿所罗门王今日向我起誓，必不用刀杀仆人。’” And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">52: 所罗门说：“他若作忠义的人，连一根头发也不至落在地上；他若行恶，必要死亡。” And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">53: 于是所罗门王差遣人，使亚多尼雅从坛上下来，他就来向所罗门王下拜，所罗门对他说：“你回家去吧！” So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor11_2">列王纪上 2</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 大卫的死期临近了，就嘱咐他儿子所罗门说： Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: “我现在要走世人必走的路，所以你当刚强作大丈夫， I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 遵守耶和华你　神所吩咐的，照着摩西律法上所写的，行主的道，谨守他的律例、诫命、典章、法度；这样，你无论作什么事，不拘往何处去，尽都亨通。 And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 耶和华必成就向我所应许的话说：‘你的子孙若谨慎自己的行为，尽心尽意诚诚实实地行在我面前，就不断人坐以色列的国位。’ That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 你知道洗鲁雅的儿子约押向我所行的，就是杀了以色列的两个元帅；尼珥的儿子押尼珥和益帖的儿子亚玛撒，他在太平之时流这二人的血，如在争战之时一样，将这血染了腰间束的带和脚上穿的鞋。 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 所以你要照你的智慧行，不容他白头安然下阴间。 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 你当恩待基列人巴西莱的众子，使他们常与你同席吃饭。因为我躲避你哥哥押沙龙的时候，他们拿食物来迎接我。 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 在你这里有巴户琳的便雅悯人，基拉的儿子示每，我往玛哈念去的那日，他用狠毒的言语咒骂我，后来却下约但河迎接我，我就指着耶和华向他起誓说：‘我必不用刀杀你。’ And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 现在你不要以他为无罪，你是聪明人，必知道怎样待他，使他白头见杀，流血下到阴间。” Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 大卫与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城。 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 大卫作以色列王四十年：在希伯仑作王七年，在耶路撒冷作王三十三年。 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 所罗门坐他父亲大卫的位，他的国甚是坚固。 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 哈及的儿子亚多尼雅去见所罗门的母亲拔示巴。拔示巴问他说：“你来是为平安吗？”回答说：“是为平安。” And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 又说：“我有话对你说。”拔示巴说：“你说吧！” He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 亚多尼雅说：“你知道国原是归我的，以色列众人也都仰望我作王；不料，国反归了我兄弟，因他得国是出乎耶和华。 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 现在我有一件事求你，望你不要推辞。”拔示巴说：“你说吧！” And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 他说：“求你请所罗门王，将书念的女子亚比煞赐我为妻，因他必不推辞你。” And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 拔示巴说：“好！我必为你对王提说。” And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 于是拔示巴去见所罗门王，要为亚多尼雅提说。王起来迎接，向她下拜，就坐在位上，吩咐人为王母设一座位，她便坐在王的右边。 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 拔示巴说：“我有一件小事求你，望你不要推辞。”王说：“请母亲说，我必不推辞。” Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 拔示巴说：“求你将书念的女子亚比煞赐给你哥哥亚多尼雅为妻。” And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 所罗门王对他母亲说：“为何单替他求书念的女子亚比煞呢？也可以为他求国吧！他是我的哥哥，他有祭司亚比亚他和洗鲁雅的儿子约押为辅佐。” And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 所罗门王就指着耶和华起誓，说：“亚多尼雅这话是自己送命，不然，愿　神重重地降罚与我！ Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 耶和华坚立我，使我坐在父亲大卫的位上，照着所应许的话为我建立家室，现在我指着永生的耶和华起誓，亚多尼雅今日必被治死。” Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 于是所罗门王差遣耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅，将亚多尼雅杀死。 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 王对祭司亚比亚他说：“你回亚拿突归自己的田地去吧！你本是该死的，但因你在我父亲大卫面前抬过主耶和华的约柜，又与我父亲同受一切苦难，所以我今日不将你杀死。” And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 所罗门就革除亚比亚他，不许他作耶和华的祭司。这样，便应验耶和华在示罗论以利家所说的话。 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 约押虽然没有归从押沙龙，却归从了亚多尼雅。他听见这风声，就逃到耶和华的帐幕，抓住祭坛的角。 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 有人告诉所罗门王说：“约押逃到耶和华的帐幕，现今在祭坛的旁边。”所罗门就差遣耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅说：“你去将他杀死。” And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 比拿雅来到耶和华的帐幕，对约押说：“王吩咐说，你出来吧！”他说：“我不出去，我要死在这里。”比拿雅就去回复王说，约押如此如此回答我。 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 王说：“你可以照着他的话行，杀死他，将他葬埋，好叫约押流无辜人血的罪，不归我和我的父家了。 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 耶和华必使约押流人血的罪归到他自己的头上，因为他用刀杀了两个比他又义又好的人，就是以色列元帅尼珥的儿子押尼珥和犹大元帅益帖的儿子亚玛撒，我父亲大卫却不知道。 And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 故此，流这二人血的罪，必归到约押和他后裔的头上，直到永远。惟有大卫和他的后裔，并他的家与国，必从耶和华那里得平安，直到永远。” Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 于是耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅上去，将约押杀死，葬在旷野约押自己的坟墓里(“坟墓”原文作“房屋”)。 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 王就立耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅作元帅，代替约押；又使祭司撒督代替亚比亚他。 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 王差遣人将示每召来，对他说：“你要在耶路撒冷建造房屋居住，不可出来往别处去。 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 你当确实地知道，你何日出来过汲沦溪，何日必死！你的罪(原文作“血”)必归到自己的头上。” For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 示每对王说：“这话甚好！我主我王怎样说，仆人必怎样行。”于是示每多日住在耶路撒冷。 And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 过了三年，示每的两个仆人逃到迦特王玛迦的儿子亚吉那里去。有人告诉示每说：“你的仆人在迦特。” And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 示每起来，备上驴，往迦特到亚吉那里去找他的仆人，就从迦特带他仆人回来。 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 有人告诉所罗门说：“示每出耶路撒冷往迦特去回来了。” And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 王就差遣人将示每召了来，对他说：“我岂不是叫你指着耶和华起誓，并且警戒你说：‘你当确实地知道，你哪日出来往别处去，哪日必死’吗？你也对我说：‘这话甚好！我必听从。’ And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 现在你为何不遵守你指着耶和华起的誓和我所吩咐你的命令呢？” Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 王又对示每说：“你向我父亲大卫所行的一切恶事，你自己心里也知道，所以耶和华必使你的罪恶归到自己的头上。 The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 惟有所罗门王必得福，并且大卫的国位必在耶和华面前坚定，直到永远。” And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 于是王吩咐耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅，他就去杀死示每。这样，便坚定了所罗门的国位。 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor11_3">列王纪上 3</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 所罗门与埃及王法老结亲，娶了法老的女儿为妻，接她进入大卫城，直等到造完了自己的宫和耶和华的殿，并耶路撒冷周围的城墙。 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 当那些日子，百姓仍在邱坛献祭，因为还没有为耶和华的名建殿。 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 所罗门爱耶和华，遵行他父亲大卫的律例，只是还在邱坛献祭烧香。 And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 所罗门王上基遍去献祭，因为在那里有极大的邱坛(“极大”或作“出名”)，他在那坛上献一千牺牲作燔祭。 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 在基遍夜间梦中，耶和华向所罗门显现，对他说：“你愿我赐你什么？你可以求。” In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 所罗门说：“你仆人我父亲大卫，用诚实、公义、正直的心，行在你面前，你就向他大施恩典；又为他存留大恩，赐他一个儿子坐在他的位上，正如今日一样。 And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 耶和华我的　神啊！如今你使仆人接续我父亲大卫作王，但我是幼童，不知道应当怎样出入。 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 仆人住在你所拣选的民中，这民多得不可胜数。 And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 所以求你赐我智慧，可以判断你的民，能辨别是非；不然，谁能判断这众多的民呢？” Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 所罗门因为求这事，就蒙主喜悦。 And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 　神对他说：“你既然求这事，不为自己求寿、求富，也不求灭绝你仇敌的性命，单求智慧可以听讼， And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 我就应允你所求的，赐你聪明智慧，甚至在你以前没有象你的，在你以后也没有象你的。 Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 你所没有求的我也赐给你，就是富足、尊荣，使你在世的日子，列王中没有一个能比你的。 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 你若效法你父亲大卫，遵行我的道，谨守我的律例、诫命，我必使你长寿。” And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 所罗门醒了，不料是个梦。他就回到耶路撒冷，站在耶和华的约柜前，献燔祭和平安祭，又为他众臣仆设摆筵席。 And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 一日，有两个妓女来，站在王面前。 Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 一个说：“我主啊！我和这妇人同住一房；她在房中的时候，我生了一个男孩。 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 我生孩子后第三日，这妇人也生了孩子；我们是同住的，除了我们二人之外，房中再没有别人。 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 夜间这妇人睡着的时候，压死了她的孩子。 And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 她半夜起来，趁我睡着，从我旁边把我的孩子抱去，放在她怀里，将她的死孩子放在我怀里。 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 天要亮的时候，我起来要给我的孩子吃奶，不料，孩子死了。及至天亮，我细细地察看，不是我所生的孩子。” And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 那妇人说：“不然，活孩子是我的，死孩子是你的。”这妇人说：“不然，死孩子是你的，活孩子是我的。”她们在王面前如此争论。 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 王说：“这妇人说：‘活孩子是我的，死孩子是你的。’那妇人说：‘不然，死孩子是你的，活孩子是我的。’” Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 就吩咐说：“拿刀来！”人就拿刀来。 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 王说：“将活孩子劈成两半，一半给那妇人，一半给这妇人。” And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 活孩子的母亲为自己的孩子心里急痛，就说：“求我主将活孩子给那妇人吧！万不可杀他。”那妇人说：“这孩子也不归我，也不归你，把他劈了吧！” Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 王说：“将活孩子给这妇人，万不可杀他，这妇人实在是他的母亲。” Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 所罗门有套车的马四万，还有马兵一万二千。 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 那十二个官吏，各按各月供给所罗门王，并一切与他同席之人的食物，一无所缺。 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 众人各按各分，将养马与快马的大麦和干草，送到官吏那里。 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 　神赐给所罗门极大的智慧聪明和广大的心，如同海沙不可测量。 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 所罗门的智慧超过东方人和埃及人的一切智慧。 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 他的智慧胜过万人，胜过以斯拉人以探，并玛曷的儿子希幔、甲各、达大的智慧；他的名声传扬在四围的列国。 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 他作箴言三千句，诗歌一千零五首。 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 他讲论草木，自黎巴嫩的香柏树，直到墙上长的牛膝草；又讲论飞禽走兽、昆虫水族。 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 天下列王听见所罗门的智慧，就都差人来听他的智慧话。 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor11_5">列王纪上 5</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 推罗王希兰，平素爱大卫。他听见以色列人膏所罗门，接续他父亲作王，就差遣臣仆来见他。 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 所罗门也差遣人去见希兰，说： And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: “你知道我父亲大卫，因四围的争战，不能为耶和华他　神的名建殿，直等到耶和华使仇敌都服在他脚下。 Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 现在耶和华我的　神使我四围平安，没有仇敌，没有灾祸。 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 我定意要为耶和华我　神的名建殿，是照耶和华应许我父亲大卫的话，说：‘我必使你儿子接续你坐你的位，他必为我的名建殿。’ And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 所以求你吩咐你的仆人，在黎巴嫩为我砍伐香柏木，我的仆人也必帮助他们，我必照你所定的，给你仆人的工价；因为你知道，在我们中间没有人象西顿人善于砍伐树木。” Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 希兰听见所罗门的话，就甚喜悦，说：“今日应当称颂耶和华，因他赐给大卫一个有智慧的儿子，治理这众多的民。” And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 希兰打发人去见所罗门，说：“你差遣人向我所提的那事，我都听见了。论到香柏木和松木，我必照你的心愿而行。 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 我的仆人必将这木料从黎巴嫩运到海里，扎成筏子，浮海运到你所指定我的地方，在那里拆开，你就可以收取。你也要成全我的心愿，将食物给我的家。” My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 于是希兰照着所罗门所要的，给他香柏木和松木； So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 所罗门给希兰麦子二万歌珥，清油二十歌珥，作他家的食物。所罗门每年都是这样给希兰。 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 耶和华照着所应许的，赐智慧给所罗门。希兰与所罗门和好，彼此立约。 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 所罗门王从以色列人，中挑取服苦的人，共有三万。 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 派他们轮流，每月一万人上黎巴嫩去，一个月在黎巴嫩，两个月在家里。亚多尼兰掌管他们。 And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 所罗门用七万扛抬的，八万在山上凿石头的； And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 此外所罗门用三千三百督工的监管工人。 Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 王下令，人就凿出又大又宝贵的石头来，用以立殿的根基。 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 所罗门的匠人和希兰的匠人，并迦巴勒人，都将石头凿好，预备木料和石头建殿。 And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor11_6">列王纪上 6</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 以色列人出埃及地后四百八十年，所罗门作以色列王第四年，西弗月，就是二月，开工建造耶和华的殿。 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 所罗门王为耶和华所建的殿，长六十肘，宽二十肘，高三十肘。 And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 殿前的廊子长二十肘，与殿的宽窄一样，阔十肘。 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 又为殿作了严紧的窗棂。 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 靠着殿墙，围着外殿内殿，造了三层旁屋： And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 下层宽五肘，中层宽六肘，上层宽七肘。殿外旁屋的梁木，搁在殿墙坎上，免得插入殿墙。 The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 建殿是用山中凿成的石头。建殿的时候，锤子、斧子，和别样铁器的响声都没有听见。 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 在殿右边当中的旁屋有门，门内有旋螺的楼梯，可以上到第二层，从第二层可以上到第三层。 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 所罗门建殿，安置香柏木的栋梁，又用香柏木板遮盖。 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 靠着殿所造的旁屋，每层高五肘，香柏木的栋梁搁在殿墙坎上。 And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 耶和华的话临到所罗门说： And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: “论到你所建的这殿，你若遵行我的律例，谨守我的典章，遵从我的一切诫命，我必向你应验我所应许你父亲大卫的话。 Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我必住在以色列人中间，并不丢弃我民以色列。” And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 所罗门建造殿宇， So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 殿里面用香柏木板贴墙，从地到棚顶，都用木板遮蔽，又用松木板铺地。 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 内殿，就是至圣所，长二十肘，从地到棚顶，用香柏木板遮蔽(或作“隔断”)。 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 内殿前的外殿，长四十肘。 And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 殿里一点石头都不显露，一概用香柏木遮蔽，上面刻着野瓜和初开的花。 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 殿里预备了内殿，好安放耶和华的约柜。 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 内殿长二十肘，宽二十肘，高二十肘，墙面都贴上精金；又用香柏木作坛，包上精金。 And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 所罗门用精金贴了殿内的墙，又用金链子挂在内殿前门扇，用金包裹。 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 全殿都贴上金子，直到贴完。内殿前的坛，也都用金包裹。 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 他用橄榄木作两个基路伯，各高十肘，安在内殿。 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 这一个基路伯有两个翅膀，各长五肘，从这翅膀尖到那翅膀尖共有十肘； And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 那一个基路伯的两个翅膀也是十肘，两个基路伯的尺寸、形象，都是一样。 And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 这基路伯高十肘，那基路伯也是如此。 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 他将两个基路伯安在内殿里，基路伯的翅膀是张开的；这基路伯的一个翅膀挨着这边的墙，那基路伯的一个翅膀挨着那边的墙，里边的两个翅膀在殿中间彼此相接。 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 又用金子包裹二基路伯。 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 内殿外殿周围的墙上，都刻着基路伯、棕树和初开的花。 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 内殿外殿的地板都贴上金子。 And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 又用橄榄木制造内殿的门扇、门楣、门框，门口有墙的五分之一。 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 在橄榄木作的两门扇上刻着基路伯、棕树和初开的花，都贴上金子。 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 又用橄榄木制造外殿的门框，门口有墙的四分之一。 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 用松木作门两扇；这扇分两扇，是折叠的；那扇分两扇，也是折叠的。 And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 上面刻着基路伯、棕树和初开的花，都用金子贴了。 And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 他又用凿成的石头三层，香柏木一层，建筑内院。 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 所罗门在位第四年，西弗月，立了耶和华殿的根基。 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 到十一年，布勒月，就是八月，殿和一切属殿的，都按着样式造成。他建殿的工夫共有七年。 And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor11_7">列王纪上 7</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 所罗门为自己建造宫室，十三年方才造成。 But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 又建造黎巴嫩林宫，长一百肘，宽五十肘，高三十肘；有香柏木柱三(原文作“四”)行，柱上有香柏木柁梁。 He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 其上以香柏木为盖，每行柱子十五根，共有四十五根。 And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 有窗户三层，窗与窗相对。 And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 所有的门框，都是厚木见方的；有窗户三层，窗与窗相对。 And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 并建造有柱子的廊子，长五十肘，宽三十肘；在这廊前又有廊子，廊外有柱子和台阶。 And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 又建造一廊，其中设立审判的座位；这廊从地到顶，都用香柏木遮蔽。 Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 廊后院内，有所罗门住的宫室，工作与这工作相同。所罗门又为所娶法老的女儿建造一宫，作法与这廊子一样。 And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 建造这一切所用的石头，都是宝贵的，是按着尺寸凿成的，是用锯里外锯齐的，从根基直到檐石，从外头直到大院，都是如此。 All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 根基是宝贵的大石头，有长十肘的，有长八肘的； And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 上面有香柏木和按着尺寸凿成宝贵的石头。 And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 大院周围有凿成的石头三层，香柏木一层；都照耶和华殿的内院和殿廊的样式。 And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 所罗门王差遣人往推罗去，将户兰召了来。 And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他是拿弗他利支派中一个寡妇的儿子，他父亲是推罗人，作铜匠的。户兰满有智慧、聪明、技能，善于各样铜作。他来到所罗门王那里，作王一切所要作的。 He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 他制造两根铜柱，每根高十八肘，围十二肘。 For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 在海边之下，周围有野瓜的样式，每肘十瓜，共有两行，是铸海的时候铸上的。 And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 有十二只铜牛驮海：三只向北，三只向西，三只向南，三只向东。海在牛上，牛尾都向内。 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 海厚一掌，边如杯边，又如百合花，可容二千罢特。 And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 他用铜制造十个盆座，每座长四肘，宽四肘，高三肘。 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 座的造法是这样：四面都有心子，心子在边子当中。 And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 心子上有狮子和牛，并基路伯；边上有小座，狮子和牛以下有垂下的璎珞。 And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 每盆座有四个铜轮和铜轴。小座的四角上在盆以下，有铸成的盆架，其旁都有璎珞。 And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 小座高一肘，口是圆的，仿佛座的样式；径一肘半，在口上有雕工，心子是方的不是圆的。 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 四个轮子在心子以下，轮轴与座相连，每轮高一肘半。 And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 轮的样式如同车轮，轴、辋、辐、毂都是铸的。 And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 每座四角上都有盆架，是与座一同铸成的。 And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 座上有圆架，高半肘；座上有撑子和心子，是与座一同铸的。 And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 在撑子和心子上刻着基路伯、狮子和棕树；周围有璎珞。 For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 十个盆座都是这样，铸法、尺、寸、样式相同。 After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 又用铜制造十个盆，每盆可容四十罢特。盆径四肘，在那十座上，每座安设一盆。 Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 五个安在殿门的右边，五个放在殿门的左边；又将海放在殿门的右旁，就是南边。 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 户兰又造了盆、铲子和盘子。这样，他为所罗门王作完了耶和华殿的一切工。 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 所造的就是两根柱子，和柱上两个如球的顶，并两个盖柱顶的网子， The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 和四百石榴，安在两个网子上；每网两行，盖着两个柱上如球的顶。 And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 十个座，和其上的十个盆。 And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 海，和海下的十二只牛。 And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 盆、铲子、盘子。这一切都是户兰给所罗门王用光亮的铜，为耶和华的殿造成的。 And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 是遵王命在约但平原，疏割和撒拉但中间，藉胶泥铸成的。 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 这一切所罗门都没有过秤，因为甚多，铜的轻重也无法可查。 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 所罗门又造耶和华殿里的金坛，和陈设饼的金桌子。 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 内殿前的精金灯台：右边五个，左边五个，并其上的金花、灯盏、蜡剪， And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 与精金的杯、盘、镊子、调羹、火鼎，以及至圣所，内殿的门枢，和外殿的门枢。 And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: 所罗门王作完了耶和华殿的一切工，就把他父大卫分别为圣的金银和器皿，都带来放在耶和华殿的府库里。 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor11_8">列王纪上 8</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 那时，所罗门将以色列的长老和各支派的首领，并以色列的族长，招聚到耶路撒冷，要把耶和华的约柜，从大卫城就是锡安运上来。 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 以他念月，就是七月，在节前，以色列人都聚集到所罗门王那里。 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 以色列长老来到，祭司便抬起约柜； And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 祭司和利未人，将耶和华的约柜运上来，又将会幕和会幕的一切圣器具都带上来。 And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 所罗门王和聚集到他那里的以色列全会众，一同在约柜前献牛羊为祭，多得不可胜数。 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 祭司将耶和华的约柜抬进内殿，就是至圣所，放在两个基路伯的翅膀底下。 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 基路伯张着翅膀，在约柜之上，遮掩约柜和抬柜的杠。 For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 这杠甚长，杠头在内殿前的圣所可以看见，在殿外却不能看见，直到如今还在那里。 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 约柜里惟有两块石版，就是以色列人出埃及地后，耶和华与他们立约的时候，摩西在何烈山所放的。除此以外，并无别物。 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 祭司从圣所出来的时候，有云充满耶和华的殿， And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 甚至祭司不能站立供职，因为耶和华的荣光充满了殿。 So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 那时所罗门说：“耶和华曾说，他必住在幽暗之处。 Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我已经建造殿宇作你的居所，为你永远的住处。” I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 王转脸为以色列会众祝福，以色列会众就都站立。 And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 所罗门说：“耶和华以色列的　神是应当称颂的！因他亲口向我父大卫所应许的，也亲手成就了。 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 他说：‘自从我领我民以色列出埃及以来，我未曾在以色列各支派中选择一城，建造殿宇为我名的居所，但拣选大卫治理我民以色列。’” Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 所罗门说：“我父大卫曾立意，要为耶和华以色列　神的名建殿。 And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 耶和华却对我父大卫说：‘你立意为我的名建殿，这意思甚好。 And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 只是你不可建殿，惟你所生的儿子必为我名建殿。’ Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 现在耶和华成就了他所应许的话，使我接续我父大卫，坐以色列的国位，又为耶和华以色列　神的名建造了殿。 And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 我也在其中为约柜预备一处。约柜内有耶和华的约，就是他领我们列祖出埃及地的时候，与他们所立的约。” And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 所罗门当着以色列会众，站在耶和华的坛前，向天举手说： And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: “耶和华以色列的　神啊！天上地下没有神可比你的！你向那尽心行在你面前的仆人，守约施慈爱； And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 向你仆人我父大卫所应许的话，现在应验了；你亲口应许，亲手成就，正如今日一样。 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 耶和华以色列的　神啊！你所应许你仆人我父大卫的话说，你的子孙若谨慎自己的行为，在我面前行事象你所行的一样，就不断人坐以色列的国位。现在求你应验这话。 Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 以色列的　神啊！求你成就向你仆人我父大卫所应许的话。 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 你仆人和你民以色列向此处祈祷的时候，求你在天上你的居所垂听，垂听而赦免。 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: “人若得罪邻舍，有人叫他起誓，他来到这殿在你的坛前起誓， If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">54: 所罗门在耶和华的坛前屈膝跪着，向天举手，在耶和华面前祷告祈求已毕，就起来， And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">55: 站着大声为以色列全会众祝福，说： And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">56: “耶和华是应当称颂的！因为他照着一切所应许的，赐平安给他的民以色列人，凡藉他仆人摩西应许赐福的话，一句都没有落空。 Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">57: 愿耶和华我们的　神与我们同在，象与我们列祖同在一样，不撇下我们，不丢弃我们。 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">58: 使我们的心归向他，遵行他的道，谨守他吩咐我们列祖的诫命、律例、典章。 That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">59: 我在耶和华面前祈求的这些话，愿耶和华我们的　神昼夜垂念，每日为他仆人与他民以色列伸冤。 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">60: 使地上的万民都知道惟独耶和华是　神，并无别神。 That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">61: 所以你们当向耶和华我们的　神存诚实的心，遵行他的律例，谨守他的诫命，至终如今日一样。” Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">62: 王和以色列众民一同在耶和华面前献祭。 And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">63: 所罗门向耶和华献平安祭，用牛二万二千，羊十二万。这样，王和以色列众民，为耶和华的殿行奉献之礼。 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">64: 当日王因耶和华殿前的铜坛太小，容不下燔祭、素祭和平安祭牲的脂油，便将耶和华殿前院子当中，分别为圣，在那里献燔祭、素祭和平安祭牲的脂油。 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">65: 那时，所罗门和以色列众人，就是从哈马口直到埃及小河所有的以色列人，都聚集成为大会，在耶和华我们的　神面前守节七日，又七日，共十四日。 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">66: 第八日王遣散众民，他们都为王祝福。因见耶和华向他仆人大卫和他民以色列所施的一切恩惠，就都心中喜乐，各归各家去了。 On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor11_9">列王纪上 9</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 所罗门建造耶和华殿和王宫，并一切所愿意建造的，都完毕了， And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 耶和华就二次向所罗门显现，如先前在基遍向他显现一样， That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 对他说：“你向我所祷告祈求的，我都应允了。我已将你所建的这殿分别为圣，使我的名永远在其中；我的眼我的心，也必常在那里。 And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 你若效法你父大卫，存诚实正直的心行在我面前，遵行我一切所吩咐你的，谨守我的律例典章， And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 我就必坚固你的国位在以色列中，直到永远，正如我应许你父大卫说：‘你的子孙必不断人坐以色列的国位。’ Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 倘若你们和你们的子孙转去不跟从我，不守我指示你们的诫命律例，去事奉敬拜别神， But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 我就必将以色列人从我赐给他们的地上剪除；并且我为己名所分别为圣的殿，也必舍弃不顾，使以色列人在万民中作笑谈，被讥诮。 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 这殿虽然甚高，将来经过的人必惊讶、嗤笑，说：‘耶和华为何向这地和这殿如此行呢？’ And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 人必回答说：‘是因此地的人离弃领他们列祖出埃及地之耶和华他们的　神，去亲近别神，事奉敬拜他，所以耶和华使这一切灾祸临到他们。’” And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 所罗门建造耶和华殿和王宫，这两所二十年才完毕了。 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: (推罗王希兰曾照所罗门所要的，资助他香柏木、松木和金子。)所罗门王就把加利利地的二十座城给了希兰。 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 希兰从推罗出来，察看所罗门给他的城邑就不喜悦， And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 说：“我兄啊！你给我的是什么城邑呢？”他就给这城邑之地起名叫迦步勒，直到今日。 And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 希兰给所罗门一百二十他连得金子。 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 所罗门王挑取服苦的人，是为建造耶和华的殿，自己的宫，米罗、耶路撒冷的城墙，夏琐、米吉多，并基色。 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 先前埃及王法老上来攻取基色，用火焚烧，杀了城内居住的迦南人，将城赐给他女儿所罗门的妻作妆奁。 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 所罗门建造基色、下伯和仑、 And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 巴拉，并国中旷野里的达莫； And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 又建造所有的积货城，并屯车和马兵的城，与耶路撒冷、黎巴嫩，以及自己治理的全国中所愿建造的。 And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 至于国中所剩下不属以色列人的亚摩利人、赫人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人， And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 就是以色列人不能灭尽的，所罗门挑取他们的后裔，作服苦的奴仆，直到今日。 Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 惟有以色列人，所罗门不使他们作奴仆，乃是作他的战士、臣仆、统领、军长、车兵长、马兵长。 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 所罗门有五百五十督工的，监管工人。 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 法老的女儿从大卫城搬到所罗门为她建造的宫里。那时，所罗门才建造米罗。 But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 所罗门每年三次在他为耶和华所筑的坛上献燔祭和平安祭，又在耶和华面前的坛上烧香。这样，他建造殿的工程完毕了。 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 所罗门王在以东地红海边，靠近以禄的以旬迦别制造船只。 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 希兰差遣他的仆人，就是熟悉泛海的船家，与所罗门的仆人一同坐船航海。 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 他们到了俄斐，从那里得了四百二十他连得金子，运到所罗门王那里。 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor11_10">列王纪上 10</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 示巴女王听见所罗门因耶和华之名所得的名声，就来要用难解的话试问所罗门。 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 跟随她到耶路撒冷的人甚多，又有骆驼驮着香料、宝石和许多金子。她来见了所罗门王，就把心里所有的对所罗门都说出来。 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 所罗门王将她所问的都答上了，没有一句不明白、不能答的。 And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 示巴女王见所罗门大有智慧和他所建造的宫室， And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 席上的珍馐美味，群臣分列而坐，仆人两旁侍立，以及他们的衣服装饰和酒政的衣服装饰；又见他上耶和华殿的台阶(或作“他在耶和华殿里所献的燔祭”)，就诧异得神不守舍； And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 对王说：“我在本国里所听见论到你的事和你的智慧，实在是真的！ And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 我先不信那些话，及至我来亲眼见了，才知道人所告诉我的还不到一半！你的智慧和你的福分，越过我所听见的风声。 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 你的臣子，你的仆人，常侍立在你面前听你智慧的话，是有福的。 Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 耶和华你的　神是应当称颂的！他喜悦你，使你坐以色列的国位。因为他永远爱以色列，所以立你作王，使你秉公行义。” Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 于是，示巴女王将一百二十他连得金子，和宝石，与极多的香料，送给所罗门王。她送给王的香料，以后奉来的不再有这样多。 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 希兰的船只从俄斐运了金子来，又从俄斐运了许多檀香木(或作“乌木“下同。)和宝石来。 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 王用檀香木为耶和华殿和王宫，作栏杆，又为歌唱的人作琴瑟。以后再没有这样的檀香木进国来，也没有人看见过，直到如今。 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 示巴女王一切所要所求的，所罗门王都送给她，另外照自己的厚意馈送她。于是女王和她臣仆转回本国去了。 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 所罗门每年所得的金子，共有六百六十六他连得。 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 另外还有商人和杂族的诸王，与国中的省长所进的金子(“杂族”在历代下九章十四节作“阿拉伯”)。 Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 所罗门王用锤出来的金子打成挡牌二百面，每面用金子六百舍客勒。 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 又用锤出来的金子打成盾牌三百面，每面用金子三弥那，都放在黎巴嫩林宫里。 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 王用象牙制造一个宝座，用精金包裹。 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 宝座有六层台阶，座的后背是圆的，两旁有扶手，靠近扶手有两个狮子站立。 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 六层台阶上有十二个狮子站立，每层有两个：左边一个，右边一个。在列国中没有这样作的。 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 所罗门王一切的饮器都是金子的。黎巴嫩林宫里的一切器皿都是精金的。所罗门年间，银子算不了什么。 And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 因为王有他施船只与希兰的船只一同航海，三年一次，装载金银、象牙、猿猴、孔雀回来。 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 所罗门王的财宝与智慧，胜过天下的列王。 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 普天下的王都求见所罗门，要听　神赐给他智慧的话。 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 他们各带贡物，就是金器、银器、衣服、军械、香料、骡马，每年有一定之例。 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 所罗门聚集战车马兵：有战车一千四百辆，马兵一万二千名，安置在屯车的城邑和耶路撒冷，就是王那里。 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 王在耶路撒冷使银子多如石头，香柏木多如高原的桑树。 And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 所罗门的马是从埃及带来的，是王的商人一群一群按着定价买来的。 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 从埃及买来的车，每辆价银六百舍客勒，马每匹一百五十舍客勒。赫人诸王和亚兰诸王所买的车马，也是按这价值经他们手买来的。 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor11_11">列王纪上 11</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 所罗门王在法老的女儿之外，又宠爱许多外邦女子，就是摩押女子、亚扪女子、以东女子、西顿女子、赫人女子。 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 论到这些国的人，耶和华曾晓谕以色列人说：“你们不可与他们往来相通，因为他们必诱惑你们的心，去随从他们的神。”所罗门却恋爱这些女子。 Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 所罗门有妃七百，都是公主；还有嫔三百。这些妃嫔诱惑他的心。 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 所罗门年老的时候，他的妃嫔诱惑他的心，去随从别神，不效法他父亲大卫诚诚实实地顺服耶和华他的　神。 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 因为所罗门随从西顿人的女神亚斯他录和亚扪人可憎的神米勒公。 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 所罗门行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，不效法他父亲大卫专心顺从耶和华。 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did David his father.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 所罗门为摩押可憎的神基抹和亚扪人可憎的神摩洛，在耶路撒冷对面的山上建筑邱坛。 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 他为那些向自己的神烧香献祭的外邦女子，就是他娶来的妃嫔也是这样行。 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 耶和华向所罗门发怒，因为他的心偏离向他两次显现的耶和华以色列的　神。 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 耶和华曾吩咐他不可随从别神，他却没有遵守耶和华所吩咐的。 And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 所以耶和华对他说：“你既行了这事，不遵守我所吩咐你守的约和律例，我必将你的国夺回，赐给你的臣子。 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 然而，因你父亲大卫的缘故，我不在你活着的日子行这事，必从你儿子的手中将国夺回。 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 只是我不将全国夺回，要因我仆人大卫和我所选择的耶路撒冷，还留一支派给你的儿子。” Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 耶和华使以东人哈达兴起，作所罗门的敌人。他是以东王的后裔。 And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 先前大卫攻击以东，元帅约押上去葬埋阵亡的人，将以东的男丁都杀了。 For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 约押和以色列众人在以东住了六个月，直到将以东的男丁尽都剪除。 (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 那时哈达还是幼童，他和他父亲的臣仆，几个以东人逃往埃及。 That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 他们从米甸起行，到了巴兰；从巴兰带着几个人，来到埃及，见埃及王法老。法老为他派定粮食，又给他房屋田地。 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 哈达在法老面前大蒙恩惠，以致法老将王后答比匿的妹子赐他为妻。 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 答比匿的妹子给哈达生了一个儿子，名叫基努拔。答比匿使基努拔在法老的宫里断奶，基努拔就与法老的众子一同住在法老的宫里。 And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 哈达在埃及听见大卫与他列祖同睡，元帅约押也死了，就对法老说：“求王容我回本国去。” And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 法老对他说：“你在我这里有什么缺乏，你竟要回你本国去呢？”他回答说：“我没有缺乏什么，只是求王容我回去。” Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 　神又使以利亚大的儿子利逊兴起，作所罗门的敌人。他先前逃避主人琐巴王哈大底谢。 And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 大卫击杀琐巴人的时候，利逊招聚了一群人，自己作他们的头目，往大马色居住，在那里作王。 And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 所罗门活着的时候，哈达为患之外，利逊也作以色列的敌人。他恨恶以色列人，且作了亚兰人的王。 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 所罗门的臣仆、尼八的儿子耶罗波安，也举手攻击王。他是以法莲支派的洗利达人，他母亲是寡妇，名叫洗鲁阿。 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 他举手攻击王的缘故，乃由先前所罗门建造米罗，修补他父亲大卫城的破口。 And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 耶罗波安是大有才能的人。所罗门见这少年人殷勤，就派他监管约瑟家的一切工程。 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 一日，耶罗波安出了耶路撒冷，示罗人先知亚希雅在路上遇见他。亚希雅身上穿着一件新衣，他们二人在田野，以外并无别人。 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 亚希雅将自己穿的那件新衣撕成十二片， And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 对耶罗波安说：“你可以拿十片。耶和华以色列的　神如此说：‘我必将国从所罗门手里夺回，将十个支派赐给你。 And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: （我因仆人大卫和我在以色列众支派中所选择的耶路撒冷城的缘故，仍给所罗门留一个支派） (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 因为他离弃我，敬拜西顿人的女神亚斯他录、摩押的神基抹，和亚扪人的神米勒公，没有遵从我的道，行我眼中看为正的事，守我的律例典章，象他父亲大卫一样。 Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 但我不从他手里将全国夺回，使他终身为君，是因我所拣选的仆人大卫谨守我的诫命律例。 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 我必从他儿子的手里将国夺回，以十个支派赐给你， But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 还留一个支派给他的儿子，使我仆人大卫在我所选择立我名的耶路撒冷城里，在我面前长有灯光。 And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 我必拣选你，使你照心里一切所愿的，作王治理以色列。 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 你若听从我一切所吩咐你的，遵行我的道，行我眼中看为正的事，谨守我的律例诫命，象我仆人大卫所行的，我就与你同在，为你立坚固的家，象我为大卫所立的一样，将以色列人赐给你。 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 我必因所罗门所行的，使大卫后裔受患难，但不至于永远。’” And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 所罗门因此想要杀耶罗波安，耶罗波安却起身逃往埃及，到了埃及王示撒那里，就住在埃及，直到所罗门死了。 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 所罗门其余的事，凡他所行的和他的智慧，都写在所罗门记上。 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 所罗门在耶路撒冷作以色列众人的王，共四十年。 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 所罗门与他列祖同睡，葬在他父亲大卫的城里。他儿子罗波安接续他作王。 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor11_12">列王纪上 12</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 罗波安往示剑去，因为以色列人都到了示剑，要立他作王。 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 尼八的儿子耶罗波安先前躲避所罗门王，逃往埃及，住在那里。(他听见这事) And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 以色列人打发人去请他来，他就和以色列会众都来见罗波安，对他说： That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: “你父亲使我们负重轭，作苦工；现在求你使我们作的苦工，负的重轭轻松些，我们就事奉你。” Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 罗波安对他们说：“你们暂且去，第三日再来见我。”民就去了。 And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 罗波安之父所罗门在世的日子，有侍立在他面前的老年人，罗波安王和他们商议，说：“你们给我出个什么主意？我好回复这民。” And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 老年人对他说：“现在王若服事这民如仆人，用好话回答他们，他们就永远作王的仆人。” And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 王却不用老年人给他出的主意，就和那些与他一同长大，在他面前侍立的少年人商议， But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 说：“这民对我说：‘你父亲使我们负重轭，求你使我们轻松些。’你们给我出个什么主意？我好回复他们。” And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 那同他长大的少年人说：“这民对王说：‘你父亲使我们负重轭，求你使我们轻松些。’王要对他们如此说：‘我的小拇指头，比我父亲的腰还粗。 And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 我父亲使你们负重轭，我必使你们负更重的轭！我父亲用鞭子责打你们，我要用蝎子鞭责打你们！’” And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 耶罗波安和众百姓遵着罗波安王所说：“你们第三日再来见我的那话，第三日他们果然来了。 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 王用严厉的话回答百姓，不用老年人给他所出的主意。 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 照着少年人所出的主意对民说：“我父亲使你们负重轭，我必使你们负更重的轭！我父亲用鞭子责打你们，我要用蝎子鞭责打你们！” And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 王不肯依从百姓，这事乃出于耶和华，为要应验他藉示罗人亚希雅对尼八的儿子耶罗波安所说的话。 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 以色列众民见王不依从他们，就对王说：“我们与大卫有什么分儿呢？与耶西的儿子并没有关涉！以色列人哪！各回各家去吧！大卫家啊！自己顾自己吧！”于是以色列人都回自己家里去了。 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 惟独住犹大城邑的以色列人，罗波安仍作他们的王。 But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 罗波安王差遣掌管服苦之人的亚多兰，往以色列人那里去，以色列人就用石头打死他。罗波安王急忙上车，逃回耶路撒冷去了。 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 这样，以色列人背叛大卫家，直到今日。 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 以色列众人听见耶罗波安回来了，就打发人去请他到会众面前，立他作以色列众人的王。除了犹大支派以外，没有顺从大卫家的。 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 罗波安来到耶路撒冷，招聚犹大全家和便雅悯支派的人，共十八万，都是挑选的战士，要与以色列家争战，好将国夺回，再归所罗门的儿子罗波安。 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 但　神的话临到神人示玛雅，说： But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: “你去告诉所罗门的儿子，犹大王罗波安，和犹大、便雅悯全家，并其余的民，说： Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: ‘耶和华如此说：你们不可上去与你们的弟兄以色列人争战，各归各家去吧！因为这事出于我。’”众人就听从耶和华的话，遵着耶和华的命回去了。 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 耶罗波安在以法莲山地建筑示剑，就住在其中；又从示剑出去，建筑毗努伊勒。 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 耶罗波安心里说，恐怕这国仍归大卫家； And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 这民若上耶路撒冷去，在耶和华的殿里献祭，他们的心必归向他们的主犹大王罗波安，就把我杀了，仍归犹大王罗波安。 If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 耶罗波安王就筹划定妥，铸造了两个金牛犊，对众民说：“以色列人哪！你们上耶路撒冷去，实在是难，这就是领你们出埃及地的神。” Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 他就把牛犊一只安在伯特利，一只安在但。 And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 这事叫百姓陷在罪里，因为他们往但去拜那牛犊。 And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 耶罗波安在邱坛那里建殿，将那不属利未人的凡民立为祭司。 And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 耶罗波安定八月十五日为节期，象在犹大的节期一样，自己上坛献祭。他在伯特利也这样向他所铸的牛犊献祭，又将立为邱坛的祭司安置在伯特利。 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 他在八月十五日，就是他私自所定的月日，为以色列人立作节期的日子，在伯特利上坛烧香。 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor11_13">列王纪上 13</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 那时，有一个神人奉耶和华的命从犹大来到伯特利，耶罗波安正站在坛旁，要烧香。 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 神人奉耶和华的命向坛呼叫，说：“坛哪！坛哪！耶和华如此说，大卫家里必生一个儿子，名叫约西亚，他必将邱坛的祭司，就是在你上面烧香的，杀在你上面，人的骨头也必烧在你上面。” And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 当日，神人设个预兆，说：“这坛必破裂，坛上的灰必倾撒，这是耶和华说的预兆。” And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 耶罗波安王听见神人向伯特利的坛所呼叫的话，就从坛上伸手，说：“拿住他吧！”王向神人所伸的手就枯干了，不能弯回。 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 坛也破裂了，坛上的灰倾撒了，正如神人奉耶和华的命所设的预兆。 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 王对神人说：“请你为我祷告，求耶和华你　神的恩典使我的手复原。”于是神人祈祷耶和华，王的手就复了原，仍如寻常一样。 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 王对神人说：“请你同我回去吃饭，加添心力，我也必给你赏赐。” And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 神人对王说：“你就是把你的宫一半给我，我也不同你进去，也不在这地方吃饭喝水， And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 因为有耶和华的话嘱咐我，说不可在伯特利吃饭喝水，也不可从你去的原路回来。” For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 于是神人从别的路回去，不从伯特利来的原路回去。 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 有一个老先知住在伯特利，他儿子们来，将神人当日在伯特利所行的一切事和向王所说的话，都告诉了父亲。 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 父亲问他们说：“神人从哪条路去了呢？”儿子们就告诉他。原来他们看见那从犹大来的神人所去的路。 And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 老先知就吩咐他儿子们说：“你们为我备驴。”他们备好了驴，他就骑上， And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 去追赶神人，遇见他坐在橡树底下，就问他说：“你是从犹大来的神人不是？”他说：“是。” And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah?

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 这是因为耶罗波安所犯的罪，使以色列人陷在罪里，惹动耶和华以色列　神的怒气。 Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 拿答其余的事，凡他所行的，都写在以色列诸王记上。 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 亚撒和以色列王巴沙在世的日子，常常争战。 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 犹大王亚撒第三年，亚希雅的儿子巴沙在得撒登基作以色列众人的王，共二十四年。 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，行耶罗波安所行的道，犯他使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor11_16">列王纪上 16</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶和华的话临到哈拿尼的儿子耶户，责备巴沙说： Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: “我既从尘埃中提拔你，立你作我民以色列的君，你竟行耶罗波安所行的道，使我民以色列陷在罪里，惹我发怒， Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 我必除尽你和你的家，使你的家象尼八的儿子耶罗波安的家一样。 Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 凡属巴沙的人，死在城中的必被狗吃；死在田野的，必被空中的鸟吃。” Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 巴沙其余的事，凡他所行的和他的勇力，都写在以色列诸王记上。 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 巴沙与他列祖同睡，葬在得撒。他儿子以拉接续他作王。 So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 耶和华的话临到哈拿尼的儿子先知耶户，责备巴沙和他的家，因他行耶和华眼中看为恶的一切事，以他手所作的惹耶和华发怒，象耶罗波安的家一样，又因他杀了耶罗波安的全家。 And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 犹大王亚撒二十六年，巴沙的儿子以拉，在得撒登基作以色列王共二年。 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 有管理他一半战车的臣子心利背叛他。当他在得撒家宰亚杂家里喝醉的时候， And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 心利就进去杀了他，篡了他的位。这是犹大王亚撒二十七年的事。 And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 心利一坐王位就杀了巴沙的全家，连他的亲属、朋友也没有留下一个男丁。 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 心利这样灭绝巴沙的全家，正如耶和华藉先知耶户责备巴沙的话。 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 这是因巴沙和他儿子以拉的一切罪，就是他们使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪，以虚无的神惹耶和华以色列　神的怒气。 For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 以拉其余的事，凡他所行的，都写在以色列诸王记上。 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 犹大王亚撒二十七年，心利在得撒作王七日。那时民正安营围攻非利士的基比顿。 In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 民在营中听说心利背叛，又杀了王，故此，以色列众人当日在营中立元帅暗利作以色列王。 And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 暗利率领以色列众人，从基比顿上去，围困得撒。 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 心利见城破失，就进了王宫的卫所，放火焚烧宫殿，自焚而死。 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 这是因他犯罪，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，行耶罗波安所行的，犯他使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。 For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 心利其余的事和他背叛的情形，都写在以色列诸王记上。 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 那时，以色列民分为两半；一半随从基纳的儿子提比尼，要立他作王；一半随从暗利。 Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 但随从暗利的民胜过随从基纳的儿子提比尼的民。提比尼死了，暗利就作了王。 But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 犹大王亚撒三十一年，暗利登基作以色列王共十二年；在得撒作王六年。 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 暗利用二他连得银子向撒玛买了撒玛利亚山，在山上造城，就按着山的原主撒玛的名，给所造的城起名叫撒玛利亚。 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 暗利行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，比他以前的列王作恶更甚。 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 因他行了尼八的儿子耶罗波安所行的，犯他使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪，以虚无的神惹耶和华以色列　神的怒气。 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 暗利其余的事和他所显出的勇力，都写在以色列诸王记上。 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 暗利与他列祖同睡，葬在撒玛利亚。他儿子亚哈接续他作王。 So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 犹大王亚撒三十八年，暗利的儿子亚哈登基作了以色列王。暗利的儿子亚哈，在撒玛利亚作以色列王二十二年。 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 暗利的儿子亚哈，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，比他以前的列王更甚， And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 犯了尼八的儿子耶罗波安所犯的罪。他还以为轻，又娶了西顿王谒巴力的女儿耶洗别为妻，去事奉敬拜巴力， And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 在撒玛利亚建造巴力的庙，在庙里为巴力筑坛。 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 亚哈又作亚舍拉，他所行的惹耶和华以色列　神的怒气，比他以前的以色列诸王更甚。 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 亚哈在位的时候，有伯特利人希伊勒重修耶利哥城；立根基的时候，丧了长子亚比兰；安门的时候，丧了幼子西割，正如耶和华藉嫩的儿子约书亚所说的话。 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor11_17">列王纪上 17</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 基列寄居的提斯比人以利亚，对亚哈说：“我指着所事奉永生耶和华以色列的　神起誓，这几年我若不祷告，必不降露不下雨。” And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 耶和华的话临到以利亚说： And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: “你离开这里，往东去，藏在约但河东边的基立溪旁。 Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 你要喝那溪里的水，我已吩咐乌鸦在那里供养你。” And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 于是，以利亚照着耶和华的话，去住在约但河东的基立溪旁。 So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 乌鸦早晚给他叼饼和肉来，他也喝那溪里的水。 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 过了些日子，溪水就干了，因为雨没有下在地上。 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 耶和华的话临到他，说： And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: “你起身往西顿的撒勒法去(“撒勒法”与路加福音四章二十六节同)住在那里，我已吩咐那里的一个寡妇供养你。” Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 以利亚就起身往撒勒法去。到了城门，见有一个寡妇在那里捡柴，以利亚呼叫她，说：“求你用器皿取点水来给我喝。” So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 她去取水的时候，以利亚又呼叫她说：“也求你拿点饼来给我。” And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 她说：“我指着永生耶和华你的　神起誓，我没有饼，坛内只有一把面，瓶里只有一点油。我现在找两根柴，回家要为我和我儿子作饼；我们吃了，死就死吧！” And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 以利亚对她说：“不要惧怕！可以照你所说的去作吧！只要先为我作一个小饼，拿来给我，然后为你和你的儿子作饼。 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 因为耶和华以色列的　神如此说：‘坛内的面必不减少，瓶里的油必不缺短，直到耶和华使雨降在地上的日子。’” For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 妇人就照以利亚的话去行。她和她家中的人，并以利亚，吃了许多日子。 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 坛内的面果不减少，瓶里的油也不缺短，正如耶和华藉以利亚所说的话。 And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 这事以后，作那家主母的妇人，她儿子病了；病得甚重，以致身无气息。 And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 妇人对以利亚说：“神人哪！我与你何干？你竟到我这里来，使　神想念我的罪，以致我的儿子死呢？” And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 以利亚对她说：“把你儿子交给我。”以利亚就从妇人怀中将孩子接过来，抱到他所住的楼中，放在自己的床上。 And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 就求告耶和华，说：“耶和华我的　神啊！我寄居在这寡妇的家里，你就降祸与她，使她的儿子死了吗？” And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 以利亚三次伏在孩子的身上，求告耶和华，说：“耶和华我的　神啊！求你使这孩子的灵魂仍入他的身体。” And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 耶和华应允以利亚的话，孩子的灵魂仍入他的身体，他就活了。 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 以利亚将孩子从楼上抱下来，进屋子交给他母亲，说：“看哪！你的儿子活了。” And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 妇人对以利亚说：“现在我知道你是神人，耶和华藉你口所说的话是真的。” And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor11_18">列王纪上 18</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 过了许久，到第三年，耶和华的话临到以利亚，说：“你去！使亚哈得见你，我要降雨在地上。” And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 以利亚就去，要使亚哈得见他。那时，撒玛利亚有大饥荒； And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 亚哈将他的家宰俄巴底召了来。俄巴底甚是敬畏耶和华， And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 耶洗别杀耶和华众先知的时候，俄巴底将一百个先知藏了，每五十人藏在一个洞里，拿饼和水供养他们。 For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 亚哈对俄巴底说：“我们走遍这地，到一切水泉旁和一切溪边，或者找得着青草，可以救活骡马，免得绝了牲畜。” And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 于是二人分地游行，亚哈独走一路，俄巴底独走一路。 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 俄巴底在路上恰与以利亚相遇，俄巴底认出他来，就俯伏在地，说：“你是我主以利亚不是？” And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 回答说：“是，你去告诉你主人说，以利亚在这里。” And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 俄巴底说：“仆人有什么罪，你竟要将我交在亚哈手里，使他杀我呢？ And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 我指着永生耶和华你的　神起誓，无论哪一邦、哪一国，我主都打发人去找你。若说你没有在那里，就必使那邦那国的人起誓说，实在是找不着你。 As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 现在你说，要去告诉你主人说，以利亚在这里； And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 恐怕我一离开你，耶和华的灵就提你到我所不知道的地方去。这样我去告诉亚哈，他若找不着你，就必杀我。仆人却是自幼敬畏耶和华的。 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 耶洗别杀耶和华众先知的时候，我将耶和华的一百个先知藏了，每五十人藏在一个洞里，拿饼和水供养他们，岂没有人将这事告诉我主吗？ Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 现在你说，要去告诉你主人说，以利亚在这里，他必杀我。” And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 以利亚说：“我指着所事奉永生的万军之耶和华起誓，我今日必使亚哈得见我。” And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 于是俄巴底去迎着亚哈告诉他；亚哈就去迎着以利亚。 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 亚哈见了以利亚，便说：“使以色列遭灾的就是你吗？” And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 以利亚说：“使以色列遭灾的不是我，乃是你和你父家，因为你们离弃耶和华的诫命，去随从巴力。 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 现在你当差遣人，招聚以色列众人和事奉巴力的那四百五十个先知，并耶洗别所供养事奉亚舍拉的那四百个先知，使他们都上迦密山去见我。” Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 亚哈就差遣人招聚以色列众人和先知，都上迦密山。 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 以利亚前来，对众民说：“你们心持两意要到几时呢？若耶和华是　神，就当顺从耶和华；若巴力是　神，就当顺从巴力。”众民一言不答。 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 以利亚对众民说：“作耶和华先知的，只剩下我一个人；巴力的先知却有四百五十个人。 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 当给我们两只牛犊，巴力的先知可以挑选一只，切成块子，放在柴上，不要点火；我也预备一只牛犊放在柴上，也不点火。 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 你们求告你们神的名，我也求告耶和华的名。那降火显应的神，就是　神。”众民回答说：“这话甚好。” And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 以利亚对巴力的先知说：“你们既是人多，当先挑选一只牛犊，预备好了，就求告你们神的名，却不要点火。” And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 他们将所得的牛犊预备好了，从早晨到午间，求告巴力的名，说：“巴力啊！求你应允我们。”却没有声音，没有应允的。他们在所筑的坛四围踊跳。 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 到了正午，以利亚嬉笑他们，说：“大声求告吧！因为他是神，他或默想，或走到一边，或行路，或睡觉，你们当叫醒他。” And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 他们大声求告，按着他们的规矩，用刀枪自割、自刺，直到身体流血。 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 从午后直到献晚祭的时候，他们狂呼乱叫，却没有声音，没有应允的，也没有理会的。 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 以利亚对众民说：“你们到我这里来！”众民就到他那里。他便重修已经毁坏耶和华的坛。 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 以利亚照雅各子孙支派的数目，取了十二块石头(耶和华的话曾临到雅各说：“你的名要叫以色列”)， And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 用这些石头为耶和华的名筑一座坛，在坛的四围挖沟，可容谷种二细亚， And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 又在坛上摆好了柴，把牛犊切成块子放在柴上，对众人说：“你们用四个桶盛满水，倒在燔祭和柴上。” And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 又说：“倒第二次！”他们就倒第二次。又说：“倒第三次！”他们就倒第三次。 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 水流在坛的四围，沟里也满了水。 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 到了献晚祭的时候，先知以利亚近前来，说：“亚伯拉罕、以撒、以色列的　神，耶和华啊！求你今日使人知道你是以色列的　神，也知道我是你的仆人，又是奉你的命行这一切事。 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 耶和华啊！求你应允我，应允我！使这民知道你耶和华是　神！又知道是你叫这民的心回转。” Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 于是，耶和华降下火来，烧尽燔祭、木柴、石头、尘土，又烧干沟里的水。 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 众民看见了，就俯伏在地，说：“耶和华是　神！耶和华是　神！” And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 以利亚对他们说：“拿住巴力的先知，不容一人逃脱！”众人就拿住他们。以利亚带他们到基顺河边，在那里杀了他们。 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 以利亚对亚哈说：“你现在可以上去吃喝，因为有多雨的响声了。” And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 亚哈就上去吃喝。以利亚上了迦密山顶，屈身在地，将脸伏在两膝之中， So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 对仆人说：“你上去，向海观看。”仆人就上去观看，说：“没有什么。”他说：“你再去观看。”如此七次。 And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 第七次仆人说：“我看见有一小片云从海里上来，不过如人手那样大。”以利亚说：“你上去告诉亚哈，当套车下去，免得被雨阻挡。” And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 霎时间天因风云黑暗，降下大雨。亚哈就坐车往耶斯列去了。 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 耶和华的灵(原文作“手”)降在以利亚身上，他就束上腰，奔在亚哈前头，直到耶斯列的城门。 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor11_19">列王纪上 19</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 亚哈将以利亚一切所行的，和他用刀杀众先知的事，都告诉耶洗别。 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 耶洗别就差遣人去见以利亚，告诉他说：“明日约在这时候，我若不使你的性命象那些人的性命一样，愿神明重重地降罚与我。” Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 以利亚见这光景，就起来逃命，到了犹大的别是巴，将仆人留在那里， And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 自己在旷野走了一日的路程，来到一棵罗腾树下(“罗腾”，小树名，松类。下同。)就坐在那里求死，说：“耶和华啊，罢了！求你取我的性命，因为我不胜于我的列祖。” But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他就躺在罗腾树下，睡着了。有一个天使拍他，说：“起来吃吧！” And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他观看，见头旁有一瓶水与炭火烧的饼，他就吃了喝了，仍然躺下。 And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 耶和华的使者第二次来拍他，说：“起来吃吧！因为你当走的路甚远。” And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 他就起来吃了喝了，仗着这饮食的力，走了四十昼夜，到了　神的山，就是何烈山。 And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他在那里进了一个洞，就住在洞中。耶和华的话临到他说：“以利亚啊！你在这里作什么？” And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 他说：“我为耶和华万军之　神大发热心，因为以色列人背弃了你的约，毁坏了你的坛，用刀杀了你的先知，只剩下我一个人，他们还要寻索我的命！” And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 耶和华说：“你出来站在山上，在我面前。”那时耶和华从那里经过，在他面前有烈风大作，崩山碎石，耶和华却不在风中；风后地震，耶和华却不在其中； And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 地震后有火，耶和华也不在火中；火后有微小的声音。 And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 以利亚听见，就用外衣蒙上脸，出来站在洞口。有声音向他说：“以利亚啊，你在这里作什么？” And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他说：“我为耶和华万军之　神大发热心，因为以色列人背弃了你的约，毁坏了你的坛，用刀杀了你的先知，只剩下我一个人，他们还要寻索我的命！” And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 耶和华对他说：“你回去，从旷野往大马色去。到了那里，就要膏哈薛作亚兰王， And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 又膏宁示的孙子耶户作以色列王；并膏亚伯米何拉人沙法的儿子以利沙作先知接续你。 And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 将来躲避哈薛之刀的，必被耶户所杀；躲避耶户之刀的，必被以利沙所杀。 And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 但我在以色列人中为自己留下七千人，是未曾向巴力屈膝的，未曾与巴力亲嘴的。” Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 于是以利亚离开那里走了，遇见沙法的儿子以利沙耕地，在他前头有十二对牛，自己赶着第十二对。以利亚到他那里去，将自己的外衣搭在他身上。 So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 以利沙就离开牛跑到以利亚那里，说：“求你容我先与父母亲嘴，然后我便跟随你。”以利亚对他说：“你回去吧！我向你作了什么呢？” And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 以利沙就离开他回去，宰了一对牛，用套牛的器具煮肉给民吃，随后就起身跟随以利亚，服事他。 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor11_20">列王纪上 20</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 亚兰王便哈达聚集他的全军，率领三十二个王，带着车马上来围攻撒玛利亚。 And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 又差遣使者进城见以色列王亚哈，对他说：“便哈达如此说： And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 你的金银都要归我，你妻子儿女中最美的也要归我。” Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 以色列王回答说：“我主我王啊！可以依着你的话，我与我所有的都归你。” And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 使者又来说：“便哈达如此说：我已差遣人去见你，要你将你的金银妻子儿女都给我。 And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 但明日约在这时候，我还要差遣臣仆到你那里，搜查你的家和你仆人的家，将你眼中一切所喜爱的都拿了去。” Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 以色列王召了国中的长老来，对他们说：“请你们看看，这人是怎样地谋害我。他先差遣人到我这里来，要我的妻子儿女和金银，我并没有推辞他。” Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 长老和百姓对王说：“不要听从他，也不要应允他！” And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 故此，以色列王对便哈达的使者说：“你们告诉我主我王说：王头一次差遣人向仆人所要的，仆人都依从；但这次所要的，我不能依从。”使者就去回复便哈达。 Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 便哈达又差遣人去见亚哈说：“撒玛利亚的尘土若够跟从我的人每人捧一捧的，愿神明重重地降罚与我！” And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 以色列王说：“你告诉他说，才顶盔贯甲的，休要象摘盔卸甲的夸口。” And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 便哈达和诸王正在帐幕里喝酒，听见这话，就对他臣仆说：“摆队吧！”他们就摆队攻城。 And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 有一个先知来见以色列王亚哈，说：“耶和华如此说，这一大群人你看见了吗？今日我必将他们交在你手里，你就知道我是耶和华。” And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 亚哈说：“藉着谁呢？”他回答说：“耶和华说，藉着跟从省长的少年人。”亚哈说：“要谁率领呢？”他说：“要你亲自率领。” And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 于是亚哈数点跟从省长的少年人，共有二百三十二名；后又数点以色列的众兵，共有七千名。 Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 午间，他们就出城。便哈达和帮助他的三十二个王，正在帐幕里痛饮。 And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 跟从省长的少年人先出城；便哈达差遣人去探望，他们回报说：“有人从撒玛利亚出来了。” And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 他说：“他们若为讲和出来，要活捉他们；若为打仗出来，也要活捉他们。” And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 跟从省长的少年人出城，军兵跟随他们。 So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 各人遇见敌人就杀。亚兰人逃跑，以色列人追赶他们；亚兰王便哈达骑着马和马兵一同逃跑。 And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 以色列王出城攻打车马，大大击杀亚兰人。 And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 那先知来见以色列王，对他说：“你当自强，留心怎样防备，因为到明年这时候，亚兰王必上来攻击你。” And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 亚兰王的臣仆对亚兰王说：“以色列人的神是山神，所以他们胜过我们；但在平原与他们打仗，我们必定得胜。 And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 王当这样行：把诸王革去，派军长代替他们。 And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 又照着王丧失军兵之数，再招募一军，马补马，车补车，我们在平原与他们打仗，必定得胜。”王便听臣仆的话去行。 And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 次年，便哈达果然点齐亚兰人上亚弗去，要与以色列人打仗。 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 以色列人也点齐军兵，预备食物，迎着亚兰人出去，对着他们安营，好象两小群山羊羔。亚兰人却满了地面。 And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 有神人来见以色列王说：“耶和华如此说：‘亚兰人既说我耶和华是山神，不是平原的神，所以我必将这一大群人都交在你手中，你们就知道我是耶和华。’” And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 以色列人与亚兰人相对安营七日，到第七日两军交战；那一日以色列人杀了亚兰人步兵十万。 And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 其余的逃入亚弗城；城墙塌倒，压死剩下的二万七千人。便哈达也逃入城，藏在严密的屋子里。 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 他的臣仆对他说：“我们听说以色列王都是仁慈的王，现在我们不如腰束麻布，头套绳索，出去投降以色列王，或者他存留王的性命。” And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 于是他们腰束麻布，头套绳索，去见以色列王，说：“王的仆人便哈达说，求王存留我的性命。”亚哈说：“他还活着吗？他是我的兄弟。” So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 这些人留心探出他的口气来，便急忙就着他的话说：“便哈达是王的兄弟。”王说：“你们去请他来。”便哈达出来见王，王就请他上车。 Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 便哈达对王说：“我父从你父那里所夺的城邑，我必归还。你可以在大马色立街市，象我父在撒玛利亚所立的一样。”亚哈说：“我照此立约，放你回去。”就与他立约，放他去了。 And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 有先知的一个门徒，奉耶和华的命对他的同伴说：“你打我吧！”那人不肯打他。 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 他就对那人说：“你既不听从耶和华的话，你一离开我，必有狮子咬死你。”那人一离开他，果然遇见狮子，把他咬死了。 Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 先知的门徒又遇见一个人，对他说：“你打我吧！”那人就打他，将他打伤。 Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 他就去了，用头巾蒙眼，改换面目，在路旁等候王。 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 王从那里经过，他向王呼叫说：“仆人在阵上的时候，有人带了一个人来，对我说：‘你看守这人，若把他失了，你的性命必代替他的性命；不然，你必交出一他连得银子来，’ And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 仆人正在忙乱之间，那人就不见了。”以色列王对他说：“你自己定妥了，必照样判断你。” And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 他急忙除掉蒙眼的头巾，以色列王就认出他是一个先知。 And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 他对王说：“耶和华如此说：‘因你将我定要灭绝的人放去，你的命就必代替他的命；你的民也必代替他的民。’” And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 于是以色列王闷闷不乐地回到撒玛利亚，进了他的宫。 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor11_21">列王纪上 21</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 这事以后，又有一事：耶斯列人拿伯在耶斯列有一个葡萄园，靠近撒玛利亚王亚哈的宫。 And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 亚哈对拿伯说：“你将你的葡萄园给我作菜园，因为是靠近我的宫；我就把更好的葡萄园换给你，或是你要银子，我就按着价值给你。” And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 拿伯对亚哈说：“我敬畏耶和华，万不敢将我先人留下的产业给你。” And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 亚哈因耶斯列人拿伯说，我不敢将我先人留下的产业给你，就闷闷不乐地回宫，躺在床上，转脸向内，也不吃饭。 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 王后耶洗别来问他说：“你为什么心里这样忧闷，不吃饭呢？” But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他回答说：“因我向耶斯列人拿伯说，你将你的葡萄园给我，我给你价银，或是你愿意，我就把别的葡萄园换给你。他却说，我不将我的葡萄园给你。” And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 王后耶洗别对亚哈说：“你现在是治理以色列国不是？只管起来，心里畅畅快快地吃饭，我必将耶斯列人拿伯的葡萄园给你。” And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 于是托亚哈的名写信，用王的印印上，送给那些与拿伯同城居住的长老贵胄。 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 信上写着说：“你们当宣告禁食，叫拿伯坐在民间的高位上， And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 又叫两个匪徒坐在拿伯对面，作见证告他说，你谤渎　神和王了。随后就把他拉出去用石头打死。” And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king.
