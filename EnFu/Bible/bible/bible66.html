Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 又使我们成为国民，作他父　神的祭司。但愿荣耀、权能归给他，直到永永远远。阿们。 And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 看哪！他驾云降临。众目要看见他，连刺他的人也要看见他，地上的万族都要因他哀哭。这话是真实的。阿们。 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 主　神说：“我是阿拉法，我是俄梅戛(“阿拉法、俄梅戛”乃希腊字母首末二字)，是昔在、今在、以后永在的全能者。” I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 我约翰就是你们的弟兄，和你们在耶稣的患难、国度、忍耐里一同有分，为　神的道，并为给耶稣作的见证，曾在那名叫拔摩的海岛上。 I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 当主日我被圣灵感动，听见在我后面有大声音如吹号，说： I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: “你所看见的，当写在书上，达与以弗所、士每拿、别迦摩、推雅推喇、撒狄、非拉铁非、老底嘉，那七个教会。” Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 我转过身来，要看是谁发声与我说话；既转过来，就看见七个金灯台。 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 灯台中间，有一位好象人子，身穿长衣，直垂到脚，胸间束着金带。 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他的头与发皆白，如白羊毛，如雪；眼目如同火焰； His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 脚好象在炉中锻炼光明的铜；声音如同众水的声音。 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 他右手拿着七星，从他口中出来一把两刃的利剑；面貌如同烈日放光。 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 我一看见，就仆倒在他脚前，象死了一样。他用右手按着我说：“不要惧怕。我是首先的，我是末后的， And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 又是那存活的；我曾死过，现在又活了，直活到永永远远；并且拿着死亡和阴间的钥匙。 I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 所以你要把所看见的，和现在的事，并将来必成的事，都写出来。 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 论到你所看见在我右手中的七星和七个金灯台的奥秘：那七星就是七个教会的使者；七灯台就是七个教会。” The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor66_2">启示录 2</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: “你要写信给以弗所教会的使者，说：‘那右手拿着七星，在七个金灯台中间行走的，说： Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 我知道你的行为、劳碌、忍耐，也知道你不能容忍恶人。你也曾试验那自称为使徒却不是使徒的，看出他们是假的来。 I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 你也能忍耐，曾为我的名劳苦，并不乏倦。 And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 然而有一件事我要责备你，就是你把起初的爱心离弃了。 Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 所以应当回想你是从哪里坠落的，并要悔改，行起初所行的事。你若不悔改，我就临到你那里，把你的灯台从原处挪去。 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 然而你还有一件可取的事，就是你恨恶尼哥拉一党人的行为，这也是我所恨恶的。 But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 圣灵向众教会所说的话，凡有耳的，就应当听。得胜的，我必将　神乐园中生命树的果子赐给他吃。’ He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: “你要写信给士每拿教会的使者，说：‘那首先的，末后的，死过又活的，说： And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 我知道你的患难，你的贫穷(你却是富足的)，也知道那自称是犹太人所说的毁谤话，其实他们不是犹太人，乃是撒但一会的人。 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 你将要受的苦你不用怕。魔鬼要把你们中间几个人下在监里，叫你们被试炼，你们必受患难十日。你务要至死忠心，我就赐给你那生命的冠冕。 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 圣灵向众教会所说的话，凡有耳的，就应当听。得胜的，必不受第二次死的害。’ He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: “你要写信给别迦摩教会的使者，说：‘那有两刃利剑的，说： And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我知道你的居所，就是有撒但座位之处；当我忠心的见证人安提帕在你们中间，撒但所住的地方被杀之时，你还坚守我的名，没有弃绝我的道。 I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 然而有几件事我要责备你，因为在你那里，有人服从了巴兰的教训；这巴兰曾教导巴勒将绊脚石放在以色列人面前，叫他们吃祭偶像之物，行奸淫的事。 But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 你那里也有人照样服从了尼哥拉一党人的教训。 So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 所以你当悔改；若不悔改，我就快临到你那里，用我口中的剑攻击他们。 Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 圣灵向众教会所说的话，凡有耳的，就应当听。得胜的，我必将那隐藏的吗哪赐给他，并赐他一块白石，石上写着新名；除了那领受的以外，没有人能认识。’ He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: “你要写信给推雅推喇教会的使者，说：‘那眼目如火焰，脚象光明铜的　神之子说： And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 我知道你的行为、爱心、信心、勤劳、忍耐；又知道你末后所行的善事，比起初所行的更多。 I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 然而有一件事我要责备你，就是你容让那自称是先知的妇人耶洗别教导我的仆人，引诱他们行奸淫，吃祭偶像之物。 Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 我曾给她悔改的机会，她却不肯悔改她的淫行。 And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 看哪！我要叫她病卧在床。那些与她行淫的人，若不悔改所行的，我也要叫他们同受大患难。 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 我又要杀死她的党类(“党类”原文作“儿女”)，叫众教会知道，我是那察看人肺腑心肠的，并要照你们的行为报应你们各人。 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 至于你们推雅推喇其余的人，就是一切不从那教训，不晓得他们素常所说撒但深奥之理的人，我告诉你们，我不将别的担子放在你们身上。 But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 但你们已经有的，总要持守，直等到我来。 But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 那得胜又遵守我命令到底的，我要赐给他权柄制伏列国； And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 他必用铁杖辖管他们(“辖管”原文作“牧”)，将他们如同窑户的瓦器打得粉碎，象我从我父领受的权柄一样。 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 我又要把晨星赐给他。 And I will give him the morning star.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 圣灵向众教会所说的话，凡有耳的，就应当听。’” He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor66_3">启示录 3</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: “你要写信给撒狄教会的使者，说：‘那有　神的七灵和七星的，说：我知道你的行为，按名你是活的，其实是死的。 And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 你要警醒，坚固那剩下将要衰微的(“衰微”原文作“死”)；因我见你的行为，在我　神面前，没有一样是完全的。 Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 所以要回想你是怎样领受，怎样听见的；又要遵守，并要悔改。若不警醒，我必临到你那里，如同贼一样。我几时临到，你也决不能知道。 Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 然而在撒狄你还有几名是未曾污秽自己衣服的，他们要穿白衣与我同行，因为他们是配得过的。 Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 凡得胜的，必这样穿白衣，我也必不从生命册上涂抹他的名；且要在我父面前，和我父众使者面前，认他的名。 He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 圣灵向众教会所说的话，凡有耳的，就应当听。’ He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: “你要写信给非拉铁非教会的使者，说：‘那圣洁、真实、拿着大卫的钥匙、开了就没有人能关，关了就没有人能开的，说： And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 我知道你的行为，你略有一点力量，也曾遵守我的道，没有弃绝我的名。看哪！我在你面前给你一个敞开的门，是无人能关的。 I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 那撒但一会的，自称是犹太人，其实不是犹太人，乃是说谎话的，我要使他们来在你脚前下拜，也使他们知道我是已经爱你了。 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 你既遵守我忍耐的道，我必在普天下人受试炼的时候，保守你免去你的试炼。 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 我必快来，你要持守你所有的，免得人夺去你的冠冕。 Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 得胜的，我要叫他在我　神殿中作柱子，他也必不再从那里出去；我又要将我　神的名和我　神城的名(这城就是从天上、从我　神那里降下来的新耶路撒冷)，并我的新名，都写在他上面。 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 圣灵向众教会所说的话，凡有耳的，就应当听。’ He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: “你要写信给老底嘉教会的使者，说：‘那为阿们的，为诚信真实见证的，在　神创造万物之上为元首的，说： And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 我知道你的行为，你也不冷也不热；我巴不得你或冷或热。 I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 你既如温水，也不冷也不热，所以我必从我口中把你吐出去。 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 你说：我是富足，已经发了财，一样都不缺；却不知道你是那困苦、可怜、贫穷、瞎眼、赤身的。 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 我劝你向我买火炼的金子，叫你富足；又买白衣穿上，叫你赤身的羞耻不露出来；又买眼药擦你的眼睛，使你能看见。 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 凡我所疼爱的，我就责备管教他；所以你要发热心，也要悔改。 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 看哪！我站在门外叩门，若有听见我声音就开门的，我要进到他那里去，我与他，他与我一同坐席。 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 得胜的，我要赐他在我宝座上与我同坐，就如我得了胜，在我父的宝座上与他同坐一般。 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 圣灵向众教会所说的话，凡有耳的，就应当听。’” He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor66_4">启示录 4</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 此后，我观看，见天上有门开了。我初次听见好象吹号的声音，对我说：“你上到这里来，我要将以后必成的事指示你。” After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 我立刻被圣灵感动，见有一个宝座安置在天上，又有一位坐在宝座上。 And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 看那坐着的，好象碧玉和红宝石；又有虹围着宝座，好象绿宝石。 And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 宝座的周围又有二十四个座位，其上坐着二十四位长老，身穿白衣，头上戴着金冠冕。 And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 有闪电、声音、雷轰，从宝座中发出。又有七盏火灯在宝座前点着；这七灯就是　神的七灵。 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 宝座前好象一个玻璃海，如同水晶。宝座中和宝座周围有四个活物，前后遍体都满了眼睛。 And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 第一个活物象狮子，第二个象牛犊，第三个脸面象人，第四个象飞鹰。 And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 四活物各有六个翅膀，遍体内外都满了眼睛。他们昼夜不住地说：“圣哉！圣哉！圣哉！主　神，是昔在、今在、以后永在的全能者。” And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 每逢四活物将荣耀、尊贵、感谢归给那坐在宝座上、活到永永远远者的时候， And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 那二十四位长老就俯伏在坐宝座的面前敬拜那活到永永远远的，又把他们的冠冕放在宝座前，说： The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 我又看见一位大力的天使大声宣传说：“有谁配展开那书卷，揭开那七印呢？” And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 在天上、地上、地底下，没有能展开、能观看那书卷的。 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 因为没有配展开、配观看那书卷的，我就大哭。 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 长老中有一位对我说：“不要哭。看哪！犹大支派中的狮子，大卫的根，他已得胜，能以展开那书卷，揭开那七印。” And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 我又看见宝座与四活物，并长老之中有羔羊站立，象是被杀过的，有七角七眼，就是　神的七灵，奉差遣往普天下去的。 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 这羔羊前来，从坐宝座的右手里拿了书卷。 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 他既拿了书卷，四活物和二十四位长老就俯伏在羔羊面前，各拿着琴和盛满了香的金炉；这香就是众圣徒的祈祷。 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他们唱新歌，说：“你配拿书卷，配揭开七印；因为你曾被杀，用自己的血从各族、各方、各民、各国中买了人来，叫他们归于　神， And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 大声说：“曾被杀的羔羊是配得权柄、丰富、智慧、能力、尊贵、荣耀、颂赞的。” Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我又听见在天上、地上、地底下、沧海里，和天地间一切所有被造之物，都说：“但愿颂赞、尊贵、荣耀、权势，都归给坐宝座的和羔羊，直到永永远远。” And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 四活物就说：“阿们。”众长老也俯伏敬拜。 And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor66_6">启示录 6</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 我看见羔羊揭开七印中第一印的时候，就听见四活物中的一个活物，声音如雷，说：“你来！” And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 我就观看，见有一匹白马；骑在马上的拿着弓，并有冠冕赐给他。他便出来，胜了又要胜。 And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 揭开第二印的时候，我听见第二个活物说：“你来！” And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 就另有一匹马出来，是红的；有权柄给了那骑马的，可以从地上夺去太平，使人彼此相杀；又有一把大刀赐给他。 And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 揭开第三印的时候，我听见第三个活物说：“你来！”我就观看，见有一匹黑马；骑在马上的手里拿着天平。 And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 我听见在四活物中似乎有声音说：“一钱银子买一升麦子，一钱银子买三升大麦；油和酒不可糟蹋。” And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 揭开第四印的时候，我听见第四个活物说：“你来！” And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 我就观看，见有一匹灰色马；骑在马上的，名字叫作死，阴府也随着他；有权柄赐给他们，可以用刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫(“瘟疫”或作“死亡”)、野兽，杀害地上四分之一的人。 And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 揭开第五印的时候，我看见在祭坛底下，有为　神的道、并为作见证被杀之人的灵魂， And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 大声喊着说：“圣洁真实的主啊，你不审判住在地上的人，给我们伸流血的冤，要等到几时呢？” And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 于是有白衣赐给他们各人，又有话对他们说，‘还要安息片时，等着一同作仆人的，和他们的弟兄，也象他们被杀，满足了数目。’ And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 揭开第六印的时候，我又看见地大震动，日头变黑象毛布，满月变红象血， And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 天上的星辰坠落于地，如同无花果树被大风摇动，落下未熟的果子一样。 And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 天就挪移，好象书卷被卷起来；山岭海岛都被挪移离开本位。 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 地上的君王、臣宰、将军、富户、壮士，和一切为奴的，自主的，都藏在山洞和岩石穴里， And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 向山和岩石说：“倒在我们身上吧！把我们藏起来，躲避坐宝座者的面目和羔羊的忿怒； And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 因为他们忿怒的大日到了，谁能站得住呢？” For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor66_7">启示录 7</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 此后我看见四位天使站在地的四角，执掌地上四方的风，叫风不吹在地上、海上和树上。 And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 我又看见另有一位天使，从日出之地上来，拿着永生　神的印。他就向那得着权柄能伤害地和海的四位天使大声喊着说： And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: “地与海并树木，你们不可伤害，等我们印了我们　神众仆人的额。” Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 我听见以色列人各支派中受印的数目有十四万四千； And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 犹大支派中受印的有一万二千；流便支派中有一万二千；迦得支派中有一万二千； Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand.

and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 那香的烟和众圣徒的祈祷，从天使的手中一同升到　神面前。 And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我又看见一个鹰飞在空中，并听见它大声说：“三位天使要吹那其余的号，你们住在地上的民，祸哉！祸哉！祸哉！” And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor66_9">启示录 9</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 口中所出来的火与烟，并硫磺，这三样灾杀了人的三分之一。 By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 这马的能力是在口里和尾巴上；因这尾巴象蛇，并且有头用以害人。 For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 其余未曾被这些灾所杀的人仍旧不悔改自己手所作的，还是去拜鬼魔和那些不能看、不能听、不能走，金、银、铜、木、石的偶像； And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 又不悔改他们那些凶杀、邪术、奸淫、偷窃的事。 Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor66_10">启示录 10</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 他手里拿着小书卷，是展开的。他右脚踏海，左脚踏地， And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 大声呼喊，好象狮子吼叫。呼喊完了，就有七雷发声。 And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 七雷发声之后，我正要写出来，就听见从天上有声音说：“七雷所说的，你要封上，不可写出来。” And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 我所看见的那踏海踏地的天使向天举起右手来， And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 指着那创造天和天上之物，地和地上之物，海和海中之物，直活到永永远远的，起誓说：“不再有时日了(或作“不再耽延了”)。 And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 但在第七位天使吹号发声的时候，　神的奥秘，就成全了，正如　神所传给他仆人众先知的佳音。” But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 我先前从天上所听见的那声音又吩咐我说：“你去，把那踏海踏地之天使手中展开的小书卷取过来。” And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 我就走到天使那里，对他说：“请你把小书卷给我。”他对我说：“你拿着吃尽了，便叫你肚子发苦，然而在你口中要甜如蜜。” And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 我从天使手中把小书卷接过来，吃尽了，在我口中果然甜如蜜，吃了以后，肚子觉得发苦了。 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 天使(原文作“他们”)对我说：“你必指着多民、多国、多方、多王再说预言。” And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor66_11">启示录 11</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 有一根苇子赐给我，当作量度的杖，且有话说：“起来！将　神的殿和祭坛，并在殿中礼拜的人，都量一量。 And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 只是殿外的院子要留下不用量，因为这是给了外邦人的；他们要践踏圣城四十二个月。 But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 我要使我那两个见证人，穿着毛衣，传道一千二百六十天。” And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他们就是那两棵橄榄树，两个灯台，立在世界之主面前的。 These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 若有人想要害他们，就有火从他们口中出来，烧灭仇敌；凡想要害他们的，都必这样被杀。 And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 这二人有权柄，在他们传道的日子叫天闭塞不下雨；又有权柄叫水变为血；并且能随时随意用各样的灾殃攻击世界。 These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 他们作完见证的时候，那从无底坑里上来的兽必与他们交战，并且得胜，把他们杀了。 And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 他们的尸首就倒在大城里的街上；这城按着灵意叫所多玛，又叫埃及，就是他们的主钉十字架之处。 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 从各民、各族、各方、各国中，有人观看他们的尸首三天半，又不许把尸首放在坟墓里。 And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 住在地上的人就为他们欢喜快乐，互相馈送礼物，因这两位先知曾叫住在地上的人受痛苦。 And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 过了这三天半，有生气从　神那里进入他们里面，他们就站起来，看见他们的人甚是害怕。 And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 两位先知听见有大声音从天上来，对他们说：“上到这里来。”他们就驾着云上了天，他们的仇敌也看见了。 And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 正在那时候，地大震动，城就倒塌了十分之一；因地震而死的有七千人，其余的都恐惧，归荣耀给天上的　神。 And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 第二样灾祸过去，第三样灾祸快到了。 The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 第七位天使吹号，天上就有大声音说：“世上的国成了我主和主基督的国。他要作王，直到永永远远。” And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 在　神面前，坐在自己位上的二十四位长老，就面伏于地，敬拜　神， And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 说：“昔在今在的主　神，全能者啊，我们感谢你！因你执掌大权作王了。 Saying, We give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 当时，　神天上的殿开了，在他殿中现出他的约柜；随后有闪电、声音、雷轰、地震、大雹。 And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor66_12">启示录 12</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 她怀了孕，在生产的艰难中疼痛呼叫。 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 天上又现出异象来：有一条大红龙，七头十角，七头上戴着七个冠冕。 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 它的尾巴拖拉着天上星辰的三分之一，摔在地上。龙就站在那将要生产的妇人面前，等她生产之后，要吞吃她的孩子。 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 妇人生了一个男孩子，是将来要用铁杖辖管万国的(“辖管”原文作“牧”)；她的孩子被提到　神宝座那里去了。 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 妇人就逃到旷野，在那里有　神给她预备的地方，使她被养活一千二百六十天。 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 在天上就有了争战。米迦勒同他的使者与龙争战，龙也同它的使者去争战， And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 并没有得胜，天上再没有它们的地方。 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 大龙就是那古蛇，名叫魔鬼，又叫撒但，是迷惑普天下的；它被摔在地上，它的使者也一同被摔下去。 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 我听见在天上有大声音说：“我　神的救恩、能力、国度，并他基督的权柄，现在都来到了；因为那在我们　神面前，昼夜控告我们弟兄的，已经被摔下去了。 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 弟兄胜过它，是因羔羊的血和自己所见证的道。他们虽至于死，也不爱惜性命。 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 所以诸天和住在其中的，你们都快乐吧！只是地与海有祸了，因为魔鬼知道自己的时候不多，就气忿忿地下到你们那里去了。” Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 龙见自己被摔在地上，就逼迫那生男孩子的妇人。 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 于是有大鹰的两个翅膀赐给妇人，叫她能飞到旷野，到自己的地方，躲避那蛇；她在那里被养活一载二载半载。 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 蛇就在妇人身后，从口中吐出水来，象河一样，要将妇人冲去。 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 地却帮助妇人，开口吞了从龙口吐出来的水(原文作“河”)。 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 龙向妇人发怒，去与她其余的儿女争战；这儿女就是那守　神诫命，为耶稣作见证的。那时龙就站在海边的沙上。 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor66_13">启示录 13</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 我又看见一个兽从海中上来，有十角七头；在十角上戴着十个冠冕，七头上有亵渎的名号。 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 我所看见的兽，形状象豹，脚象熊的脚，口象狮子的口。那龙将自己的能力、座位和大权柄，都给了它。 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 我看见兽的七头中，有一个似乎受了死伤，那死伤却医好了。全地的人都希奇，跟从那兽； And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 又拜那龙，因为它将自己的权柄给了兽；也拜兽说：“谁能比这兽，谁能与它交战呢？” And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 又赐给它说夸大亵渎话的口，又有权柄赐给它，可以任意而行四十二个月。 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 兽就开口向　神说亵渎的话，亵渎　神的名，并他的帐幕，以及那些住在天上的。 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 又任凭它与圣徒争战，并且得胜。也把权柄赐给它，制伏各族、各民、各方、各国。 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 凡住在地上，名字从创世以来没有记在被杀之羔羊生命册上的人，都要拜它。 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 凡有耳的，就应当听。 If any man have an ear, let him hear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 掳掠人的，必被掳掠；用刀杀人的，必被刀杀。圣徒的忍耐和信心就是在此。 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 我又看见另有一个兽从地中上来，有两角如同羊羔，说话好象龙。 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 它在头一个兽面前，施行头一个兽所有的权柄，并且叫地和住在地上的人拜那死伤医好的头一个兽。 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 又行大奇事，甚至在人面前，叫火从天降在地上。 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 它因赐给它权柄在兽面前能行奇事，就迷惑住在地上的人，说：“要给那受刀伤还活着的兽作个像。” And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 又有权柄赐给它，叫兽像有生气，并且能说话，又叫所有不拜兽像的人都被杀害。 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 它又叫众人，无论大小贫富，自主的，为奴的，都在右手上，或是在额上，受一个印记。 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 除了那受印记，有了兽名或有兽名数目的，都不得作买卖。 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 在这里有智慧。凡有聪明的，可以算计兽的数目，因为这是人的数目，它的数目是六百六十六。 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor66_14">启示录 14</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 我又观看，见羔羊站在锡安山，同他又有十四万四千人，都有他的名和他父的名写在额上。 And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 我听见从天上有声音，象众水的声音和大雷的声音，并且我所听见的好象弹琴的所弹的琴声。 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 他们在宝座前，并在四活物和众长老前唱歌，仿佛是新歌；除了从地上买来的那十四万四千人以外，没有人能学这歌。 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 这些人未曾沾染妇女，他们原是童身。羔羊无论往哪里去，他们都跟随他。他们是从人间买来的，作初熟的果子归与　神和羔羊。 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 在他们口中察不出谎言来，他们是没有瑕疵的。 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 我又看见另有一位天使飞在空中，有永远的福音要传给住在地上的人，就是各国、各族、各方、各民。 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 他大声说：“应当敬畏　神，将荣耀归给他；因他施行审判的时候已经到了；应当敬拜那创造天地海和众水泉源的。” Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 又有第二位天使接着说：“叫万民喝邪淫、大怒之酒的巴比伦大城倾倒了！倾倒了！” And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 又有第三位天使接着他们，大声说：“若有人拜兽和兽像，在额上或在手上受了印记， And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 这人也必喝　神大怒的酒；此酒斟在　神忿怒的杯中纯一不杂；他要在圣天使和羔羊面前，在火与硫磺之中受痛苦。 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 圣徒的忍耐就在此；他们是守　神诫命和耶稣真道的。 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我听见从天上有声音说：“你要写下：从今以后，在主里面而死的人有福了。”圣灵说：“是的，他们息了自己的劳苦，作工的果效也随着他们。” And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 我又观看，见有一片白云，云上坐着一位好象人子，头上戴着金冠冕，手里拿着快镰刀。 And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 又有一位天使从殿中出来，向那坐在云上的大声喊着说：“伸出你的镰刀来收割；因为收割的时候已经到了，地上的庄稼已经熟透了。” And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 那坐在云上的，就把镰刀扔在地上，地上的庄稼就被收割了。 And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 又有一位天使从天上的殿中出来，他也拿着快镰刀。 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 又有一位天使从祭坛中出来，是有权柄管火的，向拿着快镰刀的大声喊着说：“伸出快镰刀来，收取地上葡萄树的果子；因为葡萄熟透了。” And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 那天使就把镰刀扔在地上，收取了地上的葡萄，丢在　神忿怒的大酒醡中。 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 那酒醡踹在城外，就有血从酒醡里流出来，高到马的嚼环，远有六百里。 And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor66_15">启示录 15</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 我又看见在天上有异象，大而且奇，就是七位天使掌管末了的七灾，因为　神的大怒在这七灾中发尽了。 And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 我看见仿佛有玻璃海，其中有火搀杂。又看见那些胜了兽和兽的像，并它名字数目的人，都站在玻璃海上，拿着　神的琴， And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 唱　神仆人摩西的歌和羔羊的歌，说：“主　神，全能者啊，你的作为大哉！奇哉！万世之王啊(“世”或作“国”)，你的道途义哉！诚哉！ And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 主啊，谁敢不敬畏你，不将荣耀归与你的名呢？因为独有你是圣的；万民都要来在你面前敬拜，因你公义的作为已经显出来了。” Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 此后，我看见在天上那存法柜的殿开了。 And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 那掌管七灾的七位天使从殿中出来，穿着洁白光明的细麻衣(“细麻衣”有古卷作“宝石”)，胸间束着金带。 And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 四活物中有一个把盛满了活到永永远远之　神大怒的七个金碗给了那七位天使。 And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 因　神的荣耀和能力，殿中充满了烟，于是没有人能以进殿，直等到那七位天使所降的七灾完毕了。 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor66_16">启示录 16</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 我听见有大声音从殿中出来，向那七位天使说：“你们去，把盛　神大怒的七碗倒在地上。” And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 第一位天使便去，把碗倒在地上，就有恶而且毒的疮生在那些有兽印记、拜兽像的人身上。 And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 第二位天使把碗倒在海里，海就变成血，好象死人的血；海中的活物都死了。 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 第三位天使把碗倒在江河与众水的泉源里，水就变成血了。 And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 我听见掌管众水的天使说：“昔在、今在的圣者啊，你这样判断是公义的， And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他们曾流圣徒与先知的血，现在你给他们血喝，这是他们所该受的。” For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 我又听见祭坛中有声音说：“是的，主　神，全能者啊，你的判断义哉！诚哉！” And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 第四位天使把碗倒在日头上，叫日头能用火烤人。 And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 人被大热所烤，就亵渎那有权掌管这些灾的　神之名，并不悔改将荣耀归给　神。 And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 第五位天使把碗倒在兽的座位上，兽的国就黑暗了。人因疼痛就咬自己的舌头； And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 又因所受的疼痛和生的疮，就亵渎天上的　神，并不悔改所行的。 And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 第六位天使把碗倒在伯拉大河上，河水就干了，要给那从日出之地所来的众王预备道路。 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我又看见三个污秽的灵，好象青蛙，从龙口、兽口并假先知的口中出来。 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他们本是鬼魔的灵，施行奇事，出去到普天下众王那里，叫他们在　神全能者的大日聚集争战。 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: (看哪！我来象贼一样。那警醒，看守衣服，免得赤身而行，叫人见他羞耻的有福了！) Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 那三个鬼魔便叫众王聚集在一处，希伯来话叫作哈米吉多顿。 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 第七位天使把碗倒在空中，就有大声音从殿中的宝座上出来，说：“成了。” And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 又有闪电、声音、雷轰、大地震，自从地上有人以来，没有这样大、这样利害的地震。 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 那大城裂为三段，列国的城也都倒塌了；　神也想起巴比伦大城来，要把那盛自己烈怒的酒杯递给他。 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 各海岛都逃避了，众山也不见了。 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 又有大雹子从天落在人身上，每一个约重一他连得(“一他连得”约有九十斤)。为这雹子的灾极大，人就亵渎　神。 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor66_17">启示录 17</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 拿着七碗的七位天使中，有一位前来对我说：“你到这里来，我将坐在众水上的大淫妇所要受的刑罚指给你看。 And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 地上的君王与她行淫，住在地上的人喝醉了她淫乱的酒。” With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 我被圣灵感动，天使带我到旷野去，我就看见一个女人骑在朱红色的兽上；那兽有七头十角，遍体有亵渎的名号。 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 那女人穿着紫色和朱红色的衣服，用金子、宝石、珍珠为妆饰；手拿金杯，杯中盛满了可憎之物，就是她淫乱的污秽。 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 在她额上有名写着说：“奥秘哉！大巴比伦，作世上的淫妇和一切可憎之物的母。” And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 我又看见那女人喝醉了圣徒的血，和为耶稣作见证之人的血。我看见她，就大大地希奇。 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 天使对我说：“你为什么希奇呢？我要将这女人和驮着她的那七头十角兽的奥秘告诉你。 And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 你所看见的兽，先前有，如今没有，将要从无底坑里上来，又要归于沉沦。凡住在地上，名字从创世以来没有记在生命册上的，见先前有，如今没有，以后再有的兽，就必希奇。 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 智慧的心在此可以思想。那七头就是女人所坐的七座山， And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 又是七位王；五位已经倾倒了，一位还在，一位还没有来到；他来的时候，必须暂时存留。 And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 那先前有，如今没有的兽，就是第八位；他也和那七位同列，并且归于沉沦。 And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 你所看见的那十角就是十王；他们还没有得国，但他们一时之间要和兽同得权柄，与王一样。 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他们同心合意，将自己的能力权柄给那兽。 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他们与羔羊争战，羔羊必胜过他们，因为羔羊是万主之主、万王之王。同着羔羊的，就是蒙召、被选、有忠心的，也必得胜。” These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 天使又对我说：“你所看见那淫妇坐的众水，就是多民、多人、多国、多方。 And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 你所看见的那十角与兽必恨这淫妇，使她冷落赤身，又要吃她的肉，用火将她烧尽。 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 因为　神使诸王同心合意，遵行他的旨意，把自己的国给那兽，直等到　神的话都应验了。 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 你所看见的那女人就是管辖地上众王的大城。” And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor66_18">启示录 18</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 他大声喊着说：“巴比伦大城倾倒了！倾倒了！成了鬼魔的住处和各样污秽之灵的巢穴(或作“牢狱”。下同)，并各样污秽可憎之雀鸟的巢穴， And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 因为列国都被她邪淫大怒的酒倾倒了；地上的君王与她行淫；地上的客商因她奢华太过就发了财。” For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 我又听见从天上有声音说：“我的民哪，你们要从那城出来，免得与她一同有罪，受她所受的灾殃； And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 因她的罪恶滔天，她的不义，　神已经想起来了。 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 她怎样待人，也要怎样待她，按她所行的加倍地报应她；用她调酒的杯加倍地调给她喝。 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 她怎样荣耀自己，怎样奢华，也当叫她照样痛苦悲哀，因她心里说：‘我坐了皇后的位，并不是寡妇，决不至于悲哀。’ How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 所以在一天之内，她的灾殃要一齐来到，就是死亡、悲哀、饥荒。她又要被火烧尽了，因为审判她的主　神大有能力。” Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 地上的君王，素来与她行淫、一同奢华的，看见烧她的烟，就必为她哭泣哀号； And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 因怕她的痛苦，就远远地站着说：“哀哉！哀哉！巴比伦大城，坚固的城啊，一时之间你的刑罚就来到了。” Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 地上的客商也都为她哭泣悲哀，因为没有人再买他们的货物了； And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 这货物就是金、银、宝石、珍珠、细麻布、紫色料、绸子、朱红色料、各样香木、各样象牙的器皿，各样极宝贵的木头和铜、铁、汉白玉的器皿， The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 并肉桂、豆蔻、香料、香膏、乳香、酒、油、细面、麦子、牛、羊、车、马，和奴仆、人口。 And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: “巴比伦哪！你所贪爱的果子离开了你；你一切的珍馐美味和华美的物件也从你中间毁灭，决不能再见了。” And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 贩卖这些货物、藉着她发了财的客商，因怕她的痛苦，就远远地站着哭泣悲哀，说： The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;
