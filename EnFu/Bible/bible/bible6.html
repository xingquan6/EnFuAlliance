Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 于是约书亚吩咐百姓的官长，说： Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: “你们要走遍营中，吩咐百姓说，当预备食物；因为三日之内，你们要过这约但河，进去得耶和华你们　神赐你们为业之地。” Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 约书亚对流便人、迦得人，和玛拿西半支派的人说： And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: “你们要追念耶和华的仆人摩西所吩咐你们的话，说：‘耶和华你们的　神使你们得享平安，也必将这地赐给你们。’ Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 你们的妻子、孩子和牲畜，都可以留在约但河东摩西所给你们的地；但你们中间一切大能的勇士，都要带着兵器，在你们的弟兄前面过去，帮助他们。 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 等到耶和华使你们的弟兄，象你们一样得享平安，并且得着耶和华你们　神所赐他们为业之地；那时才可以回你们所得之地，承受为业，就是耶和华的仆人摩西在约但河东向日出之地所给你们的。” Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 他们回答约书亚说：“你所吩咐我们行的，我们都必行；你所差遣我们去的，我们都必去。 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 我们从前在一切事上怎样听从摩西，现在也必照样听从你；惟愿耶和华你的　神与你同在，象与摩西同在一样。 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 无论什么人违背你的命令，不听从你所吩咐他的一切话，就必治死他。你只要刚强壮胆。” Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor6_2">约书亚记 2</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 当下嫩的儿子约书亚从什亭暗暗打发两个人作探子，吩咐说：“你们去窥探那地和耶利哥。”于是二人去了，来到一个妓女名叫喇合的家里，就在那里躺卧。 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 有人告诉耶利哥王说：“今夜有以色列人来到这里窥探此地。” And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 耶利哥王打发人去见喇合说：“那来到你这里，进了你家的人要交出来，因为他们来窥探全地。” And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 女人将二人隐藏，就回答说：“那人果然到我这里来；他们是哪里来的我却不知道。 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 天黑，要关城门的时候，他们出去了，往哪里去我却不知道。你们快快地去追赶，就必追上。” And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: (先是女人领二人上了房顶，将他们藏在那里所摆的麻秸中。) But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 那些人就往约但河的渡口追赶他们去了。追赶他们的人一出去，城门就关了。 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 二人还没有躺卧，女人就上房顶到他们那里。 And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 对他们说：“我知道耶和华已经把这地赐给你们，并且因你们的缘故我们都惊慌了。这地的一切居民，在你们面前心都消化了； And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 因为我们听见你们出埃及的时候，耶和华怎样在你们前面使红海的水干了，并且你们怎样待约但河东的两个亚摩利王西宏和噩，将他们尽行毁灭。 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 我们一听见这些事，心就消化了。因你们的缘故，并无一人有胆气。耶和华你们的　神，本是上天下地的　神。 And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 现在我既是恩待你们，求你们指着耶和华向我起誓，也要恩待我父家，并给我一个实在的证据， Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 要救活我的父母、弟兄、姐妹，和一切属他们的，拯救我们性命不死。” And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 二人对她说：“你若不泄漏我们这件事，我们情愿替你们死；耶和华将这地赐给我们的时候，我们必以慈爱诚实待你。” And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 于是女人用绳子将二人从窗户里缒下去，因她的房子是在城墙边上，她也住在城墙上。 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 她对他们说：“你们且往山上去，恐怕追赶的人碰见你们。要在那里隐藏三天，等追赶的人回来，然后才可以走你们的路。” And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 二人对她说：“你要这样行；不然，你叫我们所起的誓，就与我们无干了。 And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 我们来到这地的时候，你要把这条朱红线绳系在缒我们下去的窗户上，并要使你的父母、弟兄，和你父的全家，都聚集在你家中。 Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 凡出了你家门往街上去的，他的罪必归到自己的头上(“罪”原文作“血”)，与我们无干了。凡在你家里的，若有人下手害他，流他血的罪，就归到我们的头上。 And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 你若泄漏我们这件事，你叫我们所起的誓，就与我们无干了。” And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 女人说：“照你们的话行吧！”于是打发他们去了，又把朱红线绳系在窗户上。 And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 二人到山上，在那里住了三天，等着追赶的人回去了。追赶的人一路找他们，却找不着。 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 二人就下山回来，过了河，到嫩的儿子约书亚那里，向他述说所遭遇的一切事。 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 又对约书亚说：“耶和华果然将那全地交在我们手中，那地的一切居民，在我们面前心都消化了。” And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor6_3">约书亚记 3</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 约书亚清早起来，和以色列众人都离开什亭，来到约但河，就住在那里，等候过河。 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 过了三天，官长走遍营中， And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 吩咐百姓说：“你们看见耶和华你们　神的约柜，又见祭司利未人抬着，就要离开所住的地方，跟着约柜去。 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 只是你们和约柜相离，要量二千肘，不可与约柜相近，使你们知道所当走的路；因为这条路你们向来没有走过。” Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 约书亚吩咐百姓说：“你们要自洁，因为明天耶和华必在你们中间行奇事。” And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 约书亚又吩咐祭司说：“你们抬起约柜，在百姓前头过去。”于是他们抬起约柜，在百姓前头走。 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 耶和华对约书亚说：“从今日起，我必使你在以色列众人眼前尊大，使他们知道我怎样与摩西同在，也必照样与你同在。 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 你要吩咐抬约柜的祭司说：‘你们到了约但河的水边上，就要在约但河水里站住。’” And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 约书亚对以色列人说：“你们近前来，听耶和华你们　神的话。” And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: - And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 约书亚说：“看哪！普天下主的约柜必在你们前头过去到约但河里，因此你们就知道在你们中间有永生　神。并且他必在你们面前赶出迦南人、赫人、希未人、比利洗人、革迦撒人、亚摩利人、耶布斯人。 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 你们现在要从以色列支派中拣选十二个人，每支派一人， Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 等到抬普天下主耶和华约柜的祭司把脚站在约但河水里，约但河的水，就是从上往下流的水，必然断绝，立起成垒。” And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 百姓离开帐棚，要过约但河的时候，抬约柜的祭司，乃在百姓的前头。 And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 他们到了约但河，脚一入水(原来约但河水，在收割的日子，涨过两岸)， And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 那从上往下流的水，便在极远之地，撒拉但旁的亚当城那里停住，立起成垒；那往亚拉巴的海，就是盐海，下流的水，全然断绝。于是百姓在耶利哥的对面过去了。 That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 抬耶和华约柜的祭司在约但河中的干地上站定，以色列众人都从干地上过去，直到国民尽都过了约但河。 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor6_4">约书亚记 4</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 国民尽都过了约但河，耶和华就对约书亚说： And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: “你从民中要拣选十二个人，每支派一人， Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 吩咐他们说：‘你们从这里，从约但河中，祭司脚站定的地方，取十二块石头带过去，放在你们今夜要住宿的地方。’” And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 于是约书亚将他从以色列人中所预备的那十二个人，每支派一人，都召了来。 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 对他们说：“你们下约但河中，过到耶和华你们　神的约柜前头，按着以色列人十二支派的数目，每人取一块石头扛在肩上。 And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 这些石头在你们中间，可以作为证据。日后你们的子孙问你们说，这些石头是什么意思？ That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 你们就对他们说，这是因为约但河的水，在耶和华的约柜前断绝；约柜过约但河的时候，约但河的水就断绝了。这些石头要作以色列人永远的纪念。” Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 以色列人就照约书亚所吩咐的，按着以色列人支派的数目，从约但河中取了十二块石头，都遵耶和华所吩咐约书亚的行了。他们把石头带过去，到他们所住宿的地方，就放在那里。 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 约书亚另把十二块石头立在约但河中；在抬约柜的祭司脚站立的地方；直到今日，那石头还在那里。 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 抬约柜的祭司站在约但河中，等到耶和华晓谕约书亚吩咐百姓的事办完了，是照摩西所吩咐约书亚的一切话。于是百姓急速过去了。 For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 众百姓尽都过了河，耶和华的约柜和祭司就在百姓面前过去。 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 流便人、迦得人、玛拿西半支派的人，都照摩西所吩咐他们的，带着兵器在以色列人前头过去。 And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 约有四万人，都准备打仗，在耶和华面前过去，到耶利哥的平原，等候上阵。 About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 当那日，耶和华使约书亚在以色列众人眼前尊大；在他平生的日子，百姓敬畏他，象从前敬畏摩西一样。 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 耶和华晓谕约书亚说： And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: “你吩咐抬法柜的祭司，从约但河里上来。” Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 约书亚就吩咐祭司说：“你们从约但河里上来。” Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 抬耶和华约柜的祭司，从约但河里上来，脚掌刚落旱地，约但河的水就流到原处，仍旧涨过两岸。 And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did before.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 正月初十日，百姓从约但河里上来，就在吉甲，在耶利哥的东边安营。 And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 他们从约但河中取来的那十二块石头，约书亚就立在吉甲， And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 对以色列人说：“日后你们的子孙问他们的父亲说，这些石头是什么意思？ And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 你们就告诉他们说，以色列人曾走干地过这约但河； Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 因为耶和华你们的　神，在你们前面，使约但河的水干了，等着你们过来，就如耶和华你们的　神，从前在我们前面，使红海干了，等着我们过来一样。 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 要使地上万民都知道耶和华的手，大有能力；也要使你们永远敬畏耶和华你们的　神。” That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor6_5">约书亚记 5</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 约但河西亚摩利人的诸王和靠海迦南人的诸王，听见耶和华在以色列人前面使约但河的水干了，等到我们过去，他们的心因以色列人的缘故就消化了，不再有胆气。 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 那时，耶和华吩咐约书亚说：“你制造火石刀，第二次给以色列人行割礼。 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 约书亚就制造了火石刀，在‘除皮山’那里给以色列人行割礼。 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 约书亚行割礼的缘故，是因为从埃及出来的众民，就是一切能打仗的男丁，出了埃及以后，都死在旷野的路上。 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 因为出来的众民都受过割礼，惟独出埃及以后，在旷野的路上所生的众民，都没有受过割礼。 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 以色列人在旷野走了四十年，等到国民，就是出埃及的兵丁，都消灭了，因为他们没有听从耶和华的话。耶和华曾向他们起誓，必不容他们看见耶和华向他们列祖起誓应许赐给我们的地，就是流奶与蜜之地。 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 他们的子孙，就是耶和华所兴起来接续他们的，都没有受过割礼；因为在路上没有给他们行割礼，约书亚这才给他们行了。 And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 国民都受完了割礼，就住在营中自己的地方，等到痊愈了。 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 耶和华对约书亚说：“我今日将埃及的羞辱从你们身上辊去了。”因此，那地方名叫吉甲，直到今日(“吉甲”就是“辊”的意思)。 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 以色列人在吉甲安营。正月十四日晚上，在耶利哥的平原守逾越节。 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 逾越节的次日，他们就吃了那地的出产；正当那日吃无酵饼和烘的谷。 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他们吃了那地的出产，第二日吗哪就止住了，以色列人也不再有吗哪了。那一年，他们却吃迦南地的出产。 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 约书亚靠近耶利哥的时候，举目观看，不料，有一个人手里有拔出来的刀，对面站立。约书亚到他那里，问他说：“你是帮助我们呢？是帮助我们敌人呢？” And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他回答说：“不是的，我来是要作耶和华军队的元帅。”约书亚就俯伏在地下拜，说：“我主有什么话吩咐仆人。” And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 耶和华军队的元帅对约书亚说：“把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站的地方是圣的。”约书亚就照着行了。 And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor6_6">约书亚记 6</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶利哥的城门因以色列人就关得严紧，无人出入。 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 耶和华晓谕约书亚说：“看哪！我已经把耶利哥和耶利哥的王，并大能的勇士，都交在你手中。 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 你们的一切兵丁要围绕这城，一日围绕一次，六日都要这样行。 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 七个祭司要拿七个羊角走在约柜前。到第七日，你们要绕城七次，祭司也要吹角。 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他们吹的角声拖长，你们听见角声，众百姓要大声呼喊，城墙就必塌陷，各人都要往前直上。” And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 嫩的儿子约书亚召了祭司来，吩咐他们说：“你们抬起约柜来，要有七个祭司拿七个羊角，走在耶和华的约柜前。” And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 又对百姓说：“你们前去绕城，带兵器的要走在耶和华的约柜前。” And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 约书亚对百姓说完了话，七个祭司拿七个羊角，走在耶和华面前吹角，耶和华的约柜在他们后面跟随。 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 带兵器的，走在吹角的祭司前面，后队随着约柜行。祭司一面走一面吹。 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 约书亚吩咐百姓说：“你们不可呼喊，不可出声，连一句话也不可出你们的口，等到我吩咐你们呼喊的日子，那时才可以呼喊。” And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 这样，他使耶和华的约柜绕城，把城绕了一次，众人回到营里，就在营里住宿。 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 约书亚清早起来，祭司又抬起耶和华的约柜。 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 七个祭司拿七个羊角，在耶和华的约柜前，时常行走吹角，带兵器的在他们前面走，后队随着耶和华的约柜行。祭司一面走一面吹。 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 第二日，众人把城绕了一次，就回营里去。六日都是这样行。 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 第七日清早，黎明的时候，他们起来，照样绕城七次；惟独这日把城绕了七次。 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 到了第七次，祭司吹角的时候，约书亚吩咐百姓说：“呼喊吧！因为耶和华已经把城交给你们了。 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 这城和其中所有的，都要在耶和华面前毁灭；只有妓女喇合与她家中所有的，可以存活，因为她隐藏了我们所打发的使者。 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 至于你们，务要谨慎，不可取那当灭的物，恐怕你们取了那当灭的物，就连累以色列的全营，使全营受咒诅。 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 惟有金子、银子，和铜铁的器皿，都要归耶和华为圣，必入耶和华的库中。” But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 于是百姓呼喊，祭司也吹角。百姓听见角声，便大声呼喊，城墙就塌陷，百姓便上去进城，各人往前直上，将城夺取。 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 又将城中所有的，不拘男女、老少，牛羊和驴，都用刀杀尽。 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 约书亚吩咐窥探地的两个人说：“你们进那妓女的家，照着你们向她所起的誓，将那女人和她所有的，都从那里带出来。” But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 当探子的两个少年人就进去，将喇合与她的父母、弟兄，和她所有的，并她一切的亲眷，都带出来，安置在以色列的营外。 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 众人就用火，将城和其中所有的焚烧了。惟有金子、银子，和铜铁的器皿，都放在耶和华殿的库中。 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 约书亚却把妓女喇合与她父家，并她所有的，都救活了；因为她隐藏了约书亚所打发窥探耶利哥的使者，她就住在以色列中，直到今日。 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 当时，约书亚叫众人起誓说：“有兴起重修这耶利哥城的人，当在耶和华面前受咒诅；他立根基的时候，必丧长子；安门的时候，必丧幼子。” And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 耶和华与约书亚同在，约书亚的声名传扬遍地。 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor6_7">约书亚记 7</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 以色列人在当灭的物上犯了罪，因为犹大支派中，谢拉的曾孙，撒底的孙子，迦米的儿子亚干，取了当灭的物，耶和华的怒气就向以色列人发作。 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 当下约书亚从耶利哥打发人往伯特利东边靠近伯亚文的艾城去，吩咐他们说：“你们上去窥探那地。”他们就上去窥探艾城。 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east side of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country.  And the men went up and viewed Ai.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 他们回到约书亚那里，对他说：“众民不必都上去，只要二三千人上去，就能攻取艾城；不必劳累众民都去，因为那里的人少。” And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 于是民中约有三千人上那里去，竟在艾城人面前逃跑了。 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 艾城的人击杀了他们三十六人，从城门前追赶他们，直到示巴琳，在下坡杀败他们。众民的心就消化如水。 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 约书亚便撕裂衣服，他和以色列的长老把灰撒在头上，在耶和华的约柜前，俯伏在地，直到晚上。 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 约书亚说：“哀哉！主耶和华啊！你为什么竟领这百姓过约但河，将我们交在亚摩利人的手中，使我们灭亡呢？我们不如住在约但河那边倒好。 And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 主啊！以色列人既在仇敌面前转背逃跑，我还有什么可说的呢？ O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 迦南人和这地一切的居民听见了，就必围困我们，将我们的名从地上除灭。那时你为你的大名要怎样行呢？” For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 耶和华吩咐约书亚说：“起来！你为何这样俯伏在地呢？ And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 以色列人犯了罪，违背了我所吩咐他们的约，取了当灭的物；又偷窃，又行诡诈，又把那当灭的放在他们的家具里。 Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 因此，以色列人在仇敌面前站立不住。他们在仇敌面前转背逃跑，是因成了被咒诅的；你们若不把当灭的物，从你们中间除掉，我就不再与你们同在了。 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 你起来，叫百姓自洁，对他们说：‘你们要自洁预备明天，因为耶和华以色列的　神这样说，以色列啊！你们中间有当灭的物。你们若不除掉，在仇敌面前必站立不住。 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 到了早晨，你们要按着支派近前来；耶和华所取的支派，要按着宗族近前来；耶和华所取的宗族，要按着家室近前来；耶和华所取的家室，要按着人丁，一个一个地近前来。 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 被取的人，有当灭的物在他那里，他和他所有的，必被火焚烧；因他违背了耶和华的约，又因他在以色列，中行了愚妄的事。’” And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 于是约书亚清早起来，使以色列人按着支派近前来；取出来的是犹大支派。 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 使犹大支派(原文作“宗族”)近前来，就取了谢拉的宗族，使谢拉的宗族，按着家室人丁，一个一个地近前来，取出来的是撒底。 And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 使撒底的家室，按着人丁，一个一个地近前来，就取出犹大支派的人谢拉的曾孙，撒底的孙子，迦米的儿子亚干。 And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 约书亚对亚干说：“我儿，我劝你将荣耀归给耶和华以色列的　神，在他面前认罪，将你所作的事告诉我，不要向我隐瞒。” And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 亚干回答约书亚说：“我实在得罪了耶和华以色列的　神。我所作的事，如此如此： And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 我在所夺的财物中，看见一件美好的示拿衣服，二百舍客勒银子，一条金子重五十舍客勒，我就贪爱这些物件，便拿去了。现今藏在我帐棚内的地里，银子在衣服底下。” When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 约书亚就打发人跑到亚干的帐棚里。那件衣服果然藏在他帐棚内，银子在底下。 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 他们就从帐棚里取出来，拿到约书亚和以色列众人那里，放在耶和华面前。 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 约书亚和以色列众人，把谢拉的曾孙亚干和那银子，那件衣服，那条金子，并亚干的儿女、牛、驴、羊、帐棚，以及他所有的，都带到亚割谷去。 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 约书亚说：“你为什么连累我们呢？今日耶和华必叫你受连累。”于是以色列众人用石头打死他，将石头扔在其上，又用火焚烧他所有的(“他所有的”原文作“他们”)。 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 众人在亚干身上堆成一大堆石头，直存到今日。于是耶和华转意，不发他的烈怒。因此那地方名叫亚割谷，直到今日(“亚割”就是“连累”的意思)。 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor6_8">约书亚记 8</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶和华对约书亚说：“不要惧怕，也不要惊惶。你起来率领一切兵丁，上艾城去，我已经把艾城的王和他的民，他的城，并他的地，都交在你手里。 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 你怎样待耶利哥和耶利哥的王，也当照样待艾城和艾城的王。只是城内所夺的财物和牲畜，你们可以取为自己的掠物。你要在城后设下伏兵。” And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 于是，约书亚和一切兵丁都起来，要上艾城去。约书亚选了三万大能的勇士，夜间打发他们前往。 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 吩咐他们说：“你们要在城后埋伏，不可离城太远，都要各自准备。 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 我与我所带领的众民，要向城前往。城里的人象初次出来攻击我们的时候，我们就在他们面前逃跑。 And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他们必出来追赶我们，直到我们引诱他们离开城，因为他们必说：‘这些人象初次在我们面前逃跑。’所以我们要在他们面前逃跑， (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 你们就从埋伏的地方起来，夺取那城；因为耶和华你们的　神，必把城交在你们手里。 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 你们夺了城以后，就放火烧城，要照耶和华的话行。这是我吩咐你们的。” And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 约书亚打发他们前往，他们就上埋伏的地方去，住在伯特利和艾城的中间，就是在艾城的西边。这夜约书亚却在民中住宿。 Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 约书亚清早起来，点齐百姓，他和以色列的长老在百姓前面上艾城去。 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 众民就是他所带领的兵丁都上去，向前直往，来到城前，在艾城北边安营。在约书亚和艾城中间有一山谷。 And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他挑了约有五千人，使他们埋伏在伯特利和艾城的中间，就是在艾城的西边。 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 于是安置了百姓，就是城北的全军和城西的伏兵。这夜约书亚进入山谷之中。 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 艾城的王看见这景况，就和全城的人，清早急忙起来，按所定的时候，出到亚拉巴前，要与以色列人交战；王却不知道在城后有伏兵。 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 约书亚和以色列众人在他们面前装败，往那通旷野的路逃跑。 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 城内的众民，都被招聚，追赶他们。艾城人追赶的时候，就被引诱离开城。 And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 艾城和伯特利城没有一人不出来追赶以色列人的，撇了敞开的城门，去追赶以色列人。 And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 耶和华吩咐约书亚说：“你向艾城伸出手里的短枪，因为我要将城交在你手里。”约书亚就向城伸出手里的短枪。 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他一伸手，伏兵就从埋伏的地方急忙起来，夺了城，跑进城去，放火焚烧。 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 艾城的人回头一看，不料，城中烟气冲天，他们就无力向左向右逃跑。那往旷野逃跑的百姓，便转身攻击追赶他们的人。 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 约书亚和以色列众人见伏兵已经夺了城，城中烟气飞腾，就转身回去，击杀艾城的人。 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 伏兵也出城迎击艾城人，艾城人就困在以色列人中间，前后都是以色列人。于是以色列人击杀他们，没有留下一个，也没有一个逃脱的， And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 生擒了艾城的王，将他解到约书亚那里。 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 以色列人在田间和旷野，杀尽所追赶一切艾城的居民，艾城人倒在刀下，直到灭尽；以色列众人就回到艾城，用刀杀了城中的人。 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 当日杀毙的人，连男带女共有一万二千，就是艾城所有的人。 And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 约书亚没有收回手里所伸出来的短枪，直到把艾城的一切居民，尽行杀灭。 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 惟独城中的牲畜和财物，以色列人都取为自己的掠物，是照耶和华所吩咐约书亚的话。 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 约书亚将艾城焚烧，使城永为高堆，荒场，直到今日。 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 又将艾城王挂在树上，直到晚上。日落的时候，约书亚吩咐人把尸首从树上取下来，丢在城门口，在尸首上堆成一大堆石头，直存到今日。 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 那时，约书亚在以巴路山上，为耶和华以色列的　神，筑一座坛， Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 是用没有动过铁器的整石头筑的，照着耶和华仆人摩西所吩咐以色列人的话，正如摩西律法书上所写的。众人在这坛上给耶和华奉献燔祭和平安祭。 As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 约书亚在那里，当着以色列人面前，将摩西所写的律法抄写在石头上。 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 以色列众人，无论是本地人、是寄居的，和长老、官长，并审判官，都站在约柜两旁，在抬耶和华约柜的祭司利未人面前，一半对着基利心山，一半对着以巴路山，为以色列民祝福，正如耶和华仆人摩西先前所吩咐的。 And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 随后约书亚将律法上祝福、咒诅的话，照着律法书上一切所写的，都宣读了一遍。 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 摩西所吩咐的一切话，约书亚在以色列全会众和妇女、孩子，并他们中间寄居的外人面前，没有一句不宣读的。 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor6_9">约书亚记 9</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 约但河西，住山地、高原，并对着黎巴嫩山沿大海一带的诸王，就是赫人、亚摩利人、迦南人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人的诸王，听见这事， And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 就都聚集，同心合意地，要与约书亚和以色列人争战。 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 基遍的居民听见约书亚向耶利哥和艾城所行的事， And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 就设诡计；假充使者，拿旧口袋和破裂缝补的旧皮酒袋驮在驴上； They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 将补过的旧鞋穿在脚上，把旧衣服穿在身上。他们所带的饼都是干的，长了霉了。 And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他们到吉甲营中见约书亚，对他和以色列人说：“我们是从远方来的，现在求你与我们立约。” And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 以色列人对这些希未人说：“只怕你们是住在我们中间的；若是这样，怎能和你们立约呢？” And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 他们对约书亚说：“我们是你的仆人。”约书亚问他们说：“你们是什么人？是从哪里来的？” And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他们回答说：“仆人从极远之地而来，是因听见耶和华你　神的名声，和他在埃及所行的一切事， And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 并他向约但河东的两个亚摩利王，就是希实本王西宏、和在亚斯他录的巴珊王噩，一切所行的事。 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 我们的长老和我们那地的一切居民对我们说：‘你们手里要带着路上用的食物，去迎接以色列人，对他们说，我们是你们的仆人；现在求你们与我们立约。’ Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 我们出来要往你们这里来的日子，从家里带出来的这饼还是热的；看哪！现在都干了，长了霉了。 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 这皮酒袋，我们盛酒的时候，还是新的；看哪！现在已经破裂。我们这衣服和鞋，因为道路甚远，也都穿旧了。” And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 以色列人受了他们些食物，并没有求问耶和华。 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 于是约书亚与他们讲和，与他们立约，容他们活着；会众的首领，也向他们起誓。 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 以色列人与他们立约之后，过了三天，才听见他们是近邻，住在以色列人中间的。 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 以色列人起行，第三天到了他们的城邑，就是基遍、基非拉、比录、基列耶琳。 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 因为会众的首领，已经指着耶和华以色列的　神向他们起誓，所以以色列人不击杀他们。全会众就向首领发怨言。 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 众首领对全会众说：“我们已经指着耶和华以色列的　神向他们起誓，现在我们不能害他们。 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 我们要如此待他们，容他们活着，免得有忿怒因我们所起的誓临到我们身上。” This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 首领又对会众说：“要容他们活着。”于是他们为全会众作了劈柴挑水的人，正如首领对他们所说的话。 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 约书亚召了他们来，对他们说：“为什么欺哄我们说，我们离你们甚远呢？其实你们是住在我们中间。 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 现在你们是被咒诅的！你们中间的人，必断不了作奴仆，为我　神的殿，作劈柴挑水的人。” Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 他们回答约书亚说：“因为有人实在告诉你的仆人，耶和华你的　神曾吩咐他的仆人摩西，把这全地赐给你们，并在你们面前灭绝这地的一切居民。所以我们为你们的缘故，甚怕丧命，就行了这事。 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 现在我们在你手中，你以怎样待我们为善为正，就怎样作吧！” And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 于是约书亚这样待他们，救他们脱离以色列人的手，以色列人就没有杀他们。 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 当日约书亚使他们在耶和华所要选择的地方，为会众和耶和华的坛，作劈柴挑水的人，直到今日。 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor6_10">约书亚记 10</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶路撒冷王亚多尼洗德听见约书亚夺了艾城，尽行毁灭，怎样待耶利哥和耶利哥的王，也照样待艾城和艾城的王。又听见基遍的居民与以色列人立了和约，住在他们中间， Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 就甚惧怕；因为基遍是一座大城，如都城一般，比艾城更大，并且城内的人都是勇士。 That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 所以耶路撒冷王亚多尼洗德打发人去见希伯仑王何咸、耶末王毗兰、拉吉王雅非亚，和伊矶伦王底璧，说： Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: “求你们上来帮助我，我们好攻打基遍；因为他们与约书亚和以色列人立了和约。” Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 于是五个亚摩利王，就是耶路撒冷王、希伯仑王、耶末王、拉吉王、伊矶伦王，大家聚集，率领他们的众军上去，对着基遍安营，攻打基遍。 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 基遍人就打发人往吉甲的营中去见约书亚，说：“你不要袖手不顾你的仆人，求你速速上来拯救我们，帮助我们；因为住山地亚摩利人的诸王都聚集攻击我们。” And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 于是约书亚和他一切兵丁，并大能的勇士，都从吉甲上去。 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 耶和华对约书亚说：“不要怕他们，因为我已将他们交在你手里，他们无一人能在你面前站立得住。” And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 约书亚就终夜从吉甲上去，猛然临到他们那里。 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 耶和华使他们在以色列人面前溃乱。约书亚在基遍大大地杀败他们，追赶他们在伯和仑的上坡路，击杀他们直到亚西加和玛基大。 And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 他们在以色列人面前逃跑，正在伯和仑下坡的时候，耶和华从天上降大冰雹在他们身上(“冰雹”原文作“石头”)，直降到亚西加，打死他们。被冰雹打死的，比以色列人用刀杀死的还多。 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 当耶和华将亚摩利人交付以色列人的日子，约书亚就祷告耶和华，在以色列人眼前说：“日头啊！你要停在基遍；月亮啊！你要止在亚雅仑谷。” Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 于是日头停留，月亮止住，直等国民向敌人报仇。这事岂不是写在雅煞珥书上吗？日头在天当中停住，不急速下落，约有一日之久。 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 在这日以前，这日以后，耶和华听人的祷告，没有象这日的，是因耶和华为以色列争战。 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 约书亚和以色列众人回到吉甲的营中。 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 那五王逃跑，藏在玛基大洞里。 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 有人告诉约书亚说：“那五王已经找到了，都藏在玛基大洞里。” And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 约书亚说：“你们把几块大石头滚到洞口，派人看守。 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 你们却不可耽延，要追赶你们的仇敌，击杀他们尽后边的人，不容他们进自己的城邑；因为耶和华你们的　神已经把他们交在你们手里。” And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 约书亚和以色列人大大杀败他们，直到将他们灭尽，其中剩下的人都进了坚固的城。 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 众百姓就安然回玛基大营中，到约书亚那里。没有一人敢向以色列人饶舌。 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 约书亚说：“打开洞口，将那五王从洞里带出来，领到我面前。” Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 众人就这样行，将那五王，就是耶路撒冷王、希伯仑王、耶末王、拉吉王、伊矶伦王，从洞里带出来，领到约书亚面前。 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 带出那五王到约书亚面前的时候，约书亚就召了以色列众人来，对那些和他同去的军长说：“你们近前来，把脚踏在这些王的颈项上。”他们就近前来，把脚踏在这些王的颈项上。 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 约书亚对他们说：“你们不要惧怕，也不要惊惶，应当刚强壮胆，因为耶和华必这样待你们所要攻打的一切仇敌。” And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 随后约书亚将这五王杀死，挂在五棵树上。他们就在树上直挂到晚上。 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 日头要落的时候，约书亚一吩咐，人就把尸首从树上取下来，丢在他们藏过的洞里，把几块大石头放在洞口，直存到今日。 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 当日约书亚夺了玛基大，用刀击杀城中的人和王。将其中一切人口尽行杀灭，没有留下一个；他待玛基大王象从前待耶利哥王一样。 And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 约书亚和以色列众人从玛基大往立拿去，攻打立拿。 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 耶和华将立拿和立拿的王，也交在以色列人手里。约书亚攻打这城，用刀击杀了城中的一切人口，没有留下一个；他待立拿王象从前待耶利哥王一样。 And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 约书亚和以色列众人从立拿往拉吉去，对着拉吉安营，攻打这城。 And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 耶和华将拉吉交在以色列人的手里。第二天约书亚就夺了拉吉，用刀击杀了城中的一切人口，是照他向立拿一切所行的。 And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 那时基色王荷兰上来帮助拉吉，约书亚就把他和他的民都击杀了，没有留下一个。 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 约书亚和以色列众人从拉吉往伊矶伦去，对着伊矶伦安营，攻打这城。 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 当日就夺了城，用刀击杀了城中的人。那日约书亚将城中的一切人口，尽行杀灭，是照他向拉吉一切所行的。 And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 约书亚和以色列众人从伊矶伦上希伯仑去，攻打这城， And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 就夺了希伯仑和属希伯仑的诸城邑，用刀将城中的人与王，并那些城邑中的人口，都击杀了，没有留下一个，是照他向伊矶伦所行的，把城中的一切人口，尽行杀灭。 And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 约书亚和以色列众人回到底璧，攻打这城， And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 就夺了底璧和属底璧的城邑，又擒获底璧的王，用刀将这些城中的人口尽行杀灭，没有留下一个；他待底璧和底璧王象从前待希伯仑和立拿与立拿王一样。 And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 这样，约书亚击杀全地的人，就是山地、南地、高原、山坡的人，和那些地的诸王，没有留下一个。将凡有气息的尽行杀灭，正如耶和华以色列的　神所吩咐的。 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 约书亚从加低斯巴尼亚攻击到迦萨，又攻击歌珊全地，直到基遍。 And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 约书亚一时杀败了这些王，并夺了他们的地；因为耶和华以色列的　神为以色列争战。 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 于是约书亚和以色列众人回到吉甲的营中。 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor6_11">约书亚记 11</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 夏琐王耶宾听见这事，就打发人去见玛顿王约巴、伸仑王、押煞王， And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 与北方、山地、基尼烈南边的亚拉巴高原，并西边多珥山冈的诸王； And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 又去见东方和西方的迦南人，与山地的亚摩利人、赫人、比利洗人、耶布斯人，并黑门山根米斯巴地的希未人。 And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 这些王和他们的众军都出来，人数多如海边的沙，并有许多马匹车辆。 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 这诸王会合，来到米伦水边，一同安营，要与以色列人争战。 And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 耶和华对约书亚说：“你不要因他们惧怕。明日这时，我必将他们交付以色列人全然杀了。你要砍断他们马的蹄筋，用火焚烧他们的车辆。” And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 于是约书亚率领一切兵丁，在米伦水边突然向前，攻打他们。 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 耶和华将他们交在以色列人手里，以色列人就击杀他们，追赶他们到西顿大城，到米斯利弗玛音，直到东边米斯巴的平原，将他们击杀，没有留下一个。 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 约书亚就照耶和华所吩咐他的去行，砍断他们马的蹄筋，用火焚烧他们的车辆。 And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 当时约书亚转回夺了夏琐，用刀击杀夏琐王；素来夏琐在这诸国中是为首的。 And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 以色列人用刀击杀城中的人口，将他们尽行杀灭，凡有气息的没有留下一个；约书亚又用火焚烧夏琐。 And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 约书亚夺了这些王的一切城邑，擒获其中的诸王，用刀击杀他们，将他们尽行杀灭，正如耶和华仆人摩西所吩咐的。 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 至于造在山冈上的城，除了夏琐以外，以色列人都没有焚烧。约书亚只将夏琐焚烧了。 But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 那些城邑所有的财物和牲畜，以色列人都取为自己的掠物；惟有一切人口，都用刀击杀，直到杀尽；凡有气息的没有留下一个。 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 耶和华怎样吩咐他仆人摩西，摩西就照样吩咐约书亚，约书亚也照样行。凡耶和华所吩咐摩西的，约书亚没有一件懈怠不行的。 As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 约书亚夺了那全地，就是山地、一带南地、歌珊全地、高原、亚拉巴、以色列的山地，和山下的高原。 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 从上西珥的哈拉山，直到黑门山下黎巴嫩平原的巴力迦得，并且擒获那些地的诸王，将他们杀死。 Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 约书亚和这诸王争战了许多年日。 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 除了基遍的希未人之外，没有一城与以色列人讲和的，都是以色列人争战夺来的。 There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 因为耶和华的意思，是要使他们心里刚硬，来与以色列人争战，好叫他们尽被杀灭，不蒙怜悯，正如耶和华所吩咐摩西的。 For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 当时约书亚来到，将住山地、希伯仑、底璧、亚拿伯、犹大山地、以色列山地所有的亚衲族人剪除了。约书亚将他们和他们的城邑尽都毁灭。 And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 在以色列人的地没有留下一个亚衲族人，只在迦萨、迦特和亚实突有留下的。 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 这样，约书亚照着耶和华所吩咐摩西的一切话，夺了那全地，就按着以色列支派的宗族，将地分给他们为业。于是国中太平没有争战了。 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes.

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 现在你要把这地分给九个支派和玛拿西半个支派为业。” Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 玛拿西那半支派和流便、迦得二支派，已经受了产业，就是耶和华的仆人摩西在约但河东所赐给他们的， With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 只是利未支派，摩西(原文作“他”)没有把产业分给他们。他们的产业，乃是献与耶和华以色列　神的火祭，正如耶和华所应许他们的。 Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 摩西按着流便支派的宗族，分给他们产业。 And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 他们的境界是亚嫩谷边的亚罗珥和谷中的城，靠近米底巴的全平原； And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 流便人的境界，就是约但河与靠近约但河的地。以上是流便人按着宗族所得为业的诸城，并属城的村庄。 And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 摩西按着迦得支派的宗族，分给他们产业。 And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the children of Gad according to their families.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 他们的境界是雅谢和基列的各城，并亚扪人的一半地，直到拉巴前的亚罗珥； And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 以上是迦得人按着宗族所得为业的诸城，并属城的村庄。 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 摩西把产业分给玛拿西半支派，是按着玛拿西半支派的宗族所分的。 And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 他们的境界是从玛哈念起，包括巴珊全地，就是巴珊王噩的全国，并在巴珊、睚珥的一切城邑，共六十个； And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 基列的一半，并亚斯他录、以得来，就是属巴珊王噩国的二城。是按着宗族给玛拿西的儿子玛吉的一半子孙。 And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 以上是摩西在约但河东对着耶利哥的摩押平原，所分给他们的产业。 These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 只是利未支派，摩西没有把产业分给他们。耶和华以色列的　神是他们的产业，正如耶和华所应许他们的。 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor6_14">约书亚记 14</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 以色列人在迦南地所得的产业，就是祭司以利亚撒和嫩的儿子约书亚，并以色列各支派的族长所分给他们的，都记在下面； And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 是照耶和华借摩西所吩咐的，把产业拈阄分给九个半支派。 By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 原来摩西在约但河东，已经把产业分给那两个半支派，只是在他们中间没有把产业分给利未人； For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 因为约瑟的子孙是两个支派，就是玛拿西和以法莲，所以没有把地分给利未人。但给他们城邑居住，并城邑的郊野，可以牧养他们的牲畜，安置他们的财物。 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 耶和华怎样吩咐摩西，以色列人就照样行，把地分了。 As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 那时犹大人来到吉甲见约书亚，有基尼洗族耶孚尼的儿子迦勒，对约书亚说：“耶和华在加低斯巴尼亚指着我与你对神人摩西所说的话，你都知道了。 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 耶和华的仆人摩西，从加低斯巴尼亚打发我窥探这地，那时我正四十岁，我按着心意回报他。 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 然而同我上去的众弟兄使百姓的心消化；但我专心跟从耶和华我的　神。 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 当日摩西起誓说：‘你脚所踏之地，定要归你和你的子孙永远为业，因为你专心跟从耶和华我的　神。’ And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 自从耶和华对摩西说这话的时候，耶和华照他所应许的，使我存活这四十五年；其间以色列人在旷野行走。看哪！现今我八十五岁了， And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 我还是强壮，象摩西打发我去的那天一样。无论是争战，是出入，我的力量那时如何，现在还是如何。 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 求你将耶和华那日应许我的这山地给我；那里有亚衲族人，并宽大坚固的城，你也曾听见了。或者耶和华照他所应许的与我同在，我就把他们赶出去。” Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 于是约书亚为耶孚尼的儿子迦勒祝福，将希伯仑给他为业。 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 所以希伯仑作了基尼洗族耶孚尼的儿子迦勒的产业，直到今日；因为他专心跟从耶和华以色列的　神。 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 希伯仑从前名叫基列亚巴。亚巴是亚衲族中最尊大的人。于是国中太平，没有争战了。 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor6_15">约书亚记 15</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 犹大支派按着宗族拈阄所得之地，是在尽南边，到以东的交界，向南直到寻的旷野。 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 他们的南界是从盐海的尽边，就是从朝南的海汊起， And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 通到亚克拉滨坡的南边，接连到寻，上到加低斯巴尼亚的南边；又过希斯仑，上到亚达珥，绕到甲加， And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 接连到押们，通到埃及小河，直通到海为止。这就是他们的南界。 From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 东界是从盐海南边到约但河口。北界是从约但河口的海汊起， And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of Jordan.

This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 约书亚照耶和华所吩咐的，将犹大人中的一段地，就是基列亚巴，分给耶孚尼的儿子迦勒。亚巴是亚衲族的始祖(基列亚巴就是希伯仑)。 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 迦勒就从那里赶出亚衲族的三个族长，就是示筛、亚希幔、挞买。 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 又从那里上去，攻击底璧的居民，这底璧从前名叫基列西弗。 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 迦勒说：“谁能攻打基列西弗将城夺取，我就把我女儿押撒给他为妻。” And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 迦勒兄弟基纳斯的儿子俄陀聂，夺取了那城，迦勒就把女儿押撒给他为妻。 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 押撒过门的时候，劝丈夫向她父亲求一块田，押撒一下驴，迦勒问她说：“你要什么？” And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 她说：“求你赐福给我，你既将我安置在南地，求你也给我水泉。”她父亲就把上泉下泉赐给她。 Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water.

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 如今耶和华你们　神照着他所应许的，使你们弟兄得享平安，现在可以转回你们的帐棚，到耶和华的仆人摩西在约但河东所赐你们为业之地。 And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 对他们说：“你们带许多财物，许多牲畜和金、银、铜、铁，并许多衣服，回你们的帐棚去，要将你们从仇敌夺来的物，与你们众弟兄同分。” And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 流便人、迦得人和玛拿西半支派的人，到了靠近约但河的一带迦南地，就在约但河那里，筑了一座坛；那坛看着高大。 And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 以色列人听说流便人、迦得人、玛拿西半支派的人，靠近约但河边，在迦南地属以色列人的那边筑了一座坛， And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 全会众一听见，就聚集在示罗，要上去攻打他们。 And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 以色列人打发祭司以利亚撒的儿子非尼哈，往基列地去见流便人、迦得人、玛拿西半支派的人。 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 又打发十个首领与非尼哈同去，就是以色列每支派的一个首领，都是以色列军中的统领。 And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 他们到了基列地，见流便人、迦得人和玛拿西半支派的人，对他们说： And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: “耶和华全会众这样说，你们今日转去不跟从耶和华，干犯以色列的　神，为自己筑一座坛，悖逆了耶和华，这犯的是什么罪呢？ Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 从前拜毗珥的罪孽，还算小吗？虽然瘟疫临到耶和华的会众，到今日我们还没有洗净这罪。 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 你们今日竟转去不跟从耶和华吗？你们今日既悖逆耶和华，明日他必向以色列全会众发怒。 But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 你们所得为业之地，若嫌不洁净，就可以过到耶和华之地，就是耶和华的帐幕所住之地，在我们中间得地业；只是不可悖逆耶和华，也不可得罪我们，在耶和华我们　神的坛以外为自己筑坛。 Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 从前谢拉的曾孙亚干，岂不是在那当灭的物上犯了罪，就有忿怒临到以色列全会众吗？那人在所犯的罪中，不独一人死亡。” Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 于是流便人、迦得人、玛拿西半支派的人，回答以色列军中的统领说： Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: “大能者　神耶和华，大能者　神耶和华，他是知道的。以色列人也必知道。我们若有悖逆的意思，或是干犯耶和华(愿你今日不保佑我们)， The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 为自己筑坛，要转去不跟从耶和华，或是要将燔祭、素祭、平安祭献在坛上，愿耶和华亲自讨我们的罪。 That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 我们行这事并非无故，是特意作的，说：恐怕日后你们的子孙对我们的子孙说，你们与耶和华以色列的　神，有何关涉呢？ And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 因为耶和华把约但河定为我们和你们这流便人、迦得人的交界，你们与耶和华无分了。这样，你们的子孙，就使我们的子孙，不再敬畏耶和华了。 For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 因此我们说：不如为自己筑一座坛，不是为献燔祭，也不是为献别的祭； Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 乃是为你我中间和你我后人中间作证据，好叫我们也在耶和华面前献燔祭、平安祭和别的祭事奉他，免得你们的子孙，日后对我们的子孙说，你们与耶和华无分了。 But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 所以我们说：日后你们对我们，或对我们的后人这样说，我们就可以回答说，你们看我们列祖所筑的坛，是耶和华坛的样式，这并不是为献燔祭，也不是为献别的祭，乃是为作你我中间的证据。 Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 我们在耶和华我们　神帐幕前的坛以外，另筑一座坛，为献燔祭、素祭和别的祭，悖逆耶和华，今日转去不跟从他，我们断没有这个意思。” God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 祭司非尼哈与会中的首领，就是与他同来以色列军中的统领，听见流便人、迦得人、玛拿西人所说的话，就都以为美。 And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 祭司以利亚撒的儿子非尼哈，对流便人、迦得人、玛拿西人说：“今日我们知道耶和华在我们中间，因为你们没有向他犯了这罪，现在你们救以色列人脱离耶和华的手了。” And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 祭司以利亚撒的儿子非尼哈，与众首领离了流便人、迦得人，从基列地回往迦南地，到了以色列人那里，便将这事回报他们。 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 以色列人以这事为美，就称颂　神，不再提上去攻打流便人、迦得人、毁坏他们所住的地了。 And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 流便人、迦得人给坛起名叫证坛，意思说：这坛在我们中间证明耶和华是　神。 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor6_23">约书亚记 23</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶和华使以色列人安静，不与四围的一切仇敌争战，已经多日。约书亚年纪老迈， And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 就把以色列众人的长老、族长、审判官并官长，都召了来，对他们说：“我年纪已经老迈。 And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 耶和华你们的　神，因你们的缘故，向那些国所行的一切事，你们亲眼看见了；因那为你们争战的，是耶和华你们的　神。 And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 所以你们要大大壮胆，谨守遵行写在摩西律法书上的一切话，不可偏离左右。 Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 不可与你们中间所剩下的这些国民搀杂。他们的神，你们不可提他的名，不可指着他起誓，也不可事奉、叩拜； That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 你们一人必追赶千人，因耶和华你们的　神照他所应许的，为你们争战。 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: “我现在要走世人必走的路，你们是一心一意地知道，耶和华你们　神所应许赐福与你们的话，没有一句落空，都应验在你们身上了。 And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 你们列祖哀求耶和华，他就使你们和埃及人中间黑暗了；又使海水淹没埃及人。我在埃及所行的事，你们亲眼见过。“你们在旷野也住了许多年日。 And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 我领你们到约但河东亚摩利人所住之地。他们与你们争战，我将他们交在你们手中，你们便得了他们的地为业；我也在你们面前，将他们灭绝。 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 那时摩押王西拨的儿子巴勒，起来攻击以色列人，打发人召了比珥的儿子巴兰来，咒诅你们。 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 我不肯听巴兰的话，所以他倒为你们连连祝福。这样，我便救你们脱离巴勒的手。 But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 你们过了约但河，到了耶利哥；耶利哥人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、迦南人、赫人、革迦撒人、希未人、耶布斯人，都与你们争战，我把他们交在你们手里。 And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 我打发黄蜂飞在你们前面，将亚摩利人的二王，从你们面前撵出，并不是用你的刀，也不是用你的弓。 And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我赐给你们地土，非你们所修治的；我赐给你们城邑，非你们所建造的。你们就住在其中，又得吃非你们所栽种的葡萄园、橄榄园的果子。 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: “现在你们要敬畏耶和华，诚心实意地事奉他，将你们列祖在大河那边和在埃及所事奉的神除掉，去事奉耶和华。 Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 若是你们以事奉耶和华为不好，今日就可以选择所要事奉的；是你们列祖在大河那边所事奉的神呢？是你们所住这地的亚摩利人的神呢？至于我和我家，我们必定事奉耶和华。” And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 百姓回答说：“我们断不敢离弃耶和华去事奉别神， And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 因耶和华我们的　神，曾将我们和我们列祖从埃及地的为奴之家领出来，在我们眼前行了那些大神迹，在我们所行的道上，所经过的诸国，都保护了我们。 For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 耶和华又把住此地的亚摩利人，都从我们面前赶出去。所以我们必事奉耶和华，因为他是我们的　神。” And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 约书亚对百姓说：“你们不能事奉耶和华，因为他是圣洁的　神，是忌邪的　神，必不赦免你们的过犯罪恶。 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 你们若离弃耶和华去事奉外邦神，耶和华在降福之后，必转而降祸与你们，把你们灭绝。” If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 百姓回答约书亚说：“不然，我们定要事奉耶和华。” And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 约书亚对百姓说：“你们选定耶和华要事奉他，你们自己作见证吧！”他们说：“我们愿意作见证。” And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 约书亚说：“你们现在要除掉你们中间的外邦神，专心归向耶和华以色列的　神。” Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 百姓回答约书亚说：“我们必事奉耶和华我们的　神，听从他的话。” And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 当日，约书亚就与百姓立约，在示剑为他们立定律例、典章。 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 约书亚将这些话都写在　神的律法书上；又将一块大石头，立在橡树下耶和华的圣所旁边。 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 约书亚对百姓说：“看哪！这石头可以向我们作见证，因为是听见了耶和华所吩咐我们的一切话，倘或你们背弃你们的　神，这石头就可以向你们作见证(“倘或云云”或作“所以要向你们作见证，免得你们背弃耶和华你们的　神”)。” And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 于是约书亚打发百姓各归自己的地业去了。 So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 这些事以后，耶和华的仆人嫩的儿子约书亚，正一百一十岁就死了。 And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 以色列人将他葬在他地业的境内，就是在以法莲山地的亭拿西拉，在迦实山的北边。 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 约书亚在世和约书亚死后，那些知道耶和华为以色列人所行诸事的长老还在的时候，以色列人事奉耶和华。 And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 以色列人从埃及所带来约瑟的骸骨，葬埋在示剑，就是在雅各从前用一百块银子，向示剑的父亲，哈抹的子孙所买的那块地里，这就作了约瑟子孙的产业。 And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 亚伦的儿子以利亚撒也死了，就把他葬在他儿子非尼哈，以法莲山地所得的小山上。 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.</p>
