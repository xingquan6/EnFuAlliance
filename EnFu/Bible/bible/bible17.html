margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 亚哈随鲁王在书珊城的宫登基。 That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 在位第三年，为他一切首领臣仆设摆筵席，有波斯和玛代的权贵，就是各省的贵胄与首领，在他面前。 In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他把他荣耀之国的丰富，和他美好威严的尊贵，给他们看了许多日，就是一百八十日。 When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 这日子满了，又为所有住书珊城的大小人民，在御园的院子里设摆筵席七日。 And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 有白色、绿色、蓝色的帐子，用细麻绳、紫色绳，从银环内系在白玉石柱上。有金银的床榻，摆在红白黄黑玉石铺的石地上。 Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 用金器皿赐酒，器皿各有不同，御酒甚多，足显王的厚意。 And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 喝酒有例，不准勉强人，因王吩咐宫里的一切臣宰，让人各随己意。 And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 王后瓦实提在亚哈随鲁王的宫内，也为妇女设摆筵席。 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 第七日，亚哈随鲁王饮酒心中快乐，就吩咐在他面前侍立的七个太监：米户幔、比斯他、哈波拿、比革他、亚拔他、西达、甲迦， On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 请王后瓦实提头戴王后的冠冕到王面前，使各等臣民看她的美貌，因为她容貌甚美。 To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 王后瓦实提却不肯遵太监所传的王命而来，所以王甚发怒，心如火烧。 But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: - Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 那时，在王左右常见王面，国中坐高位的，有波斯和玛代的七个大臣，就是甲示拿、示达、押玛他、他施斯、米力、玛西拿、米母干，都是达时务的明哲人。按王的常规，办事必先询问知例明法的人。王问他们说： And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: “王后瓦实提不遵太监所传的王命，照例应当怎样办理呢？” What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 米母干在王和众首领面前回答说：“王后瓦实提这事不但得罪王，并且有害于王各省的臣民。 And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 因为王后这事必传到众妇人的耳中，说，亚哈随鲁王吩咐王后瓦实提到王面前，她却不来。她们就藐视自己的丈夫。 For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 今日波斯和玛代的众夫人听见王后这事，必向王的大臣照样行，从此必大开藐视和忿怒之端。 Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 王若以为美，就降旨写在波斯和玛代人的例中，永不更改，不准瓦实提再到王面前，将她王后的位分赐给比她还好的人。 If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 所降的旨意传遍通国(国度本来广大)，所有的妇人，无论丈夫贵贱都必尊敬他。” And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 王和众首领都以米母干的话为美，王就照这话去行。 And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 发诏书，用各省的文字，各族的方言，通知各省，使为丈夫的在家中作主，各说本地的方言。 For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor17_2">以斯帖记 2</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 这事以后，亚哈随鲁王的忿怒止息，就想念瓦实提和她所行的，并怎样降旨办她。 After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 于是王的侍臣对王说：“不如为王寻找美貌的处女。 Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 王可以派官在国中的各省，招聚美貌的处女到书珊城(或作“宫”)的女院，交给掌管女子的太监希该，给她们当用的香品。 And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 王所喜爱的女子，可以立为王后，代替瓦实提。”王以这事为美，就如此行。 And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 书珊城有一个犹大人，名叫末底改，是便雅悯人基士的曾孙，示每的孙子，睚珥的儿子。 Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 从前巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒将犹大王耶哥尼雅(又名“约雅斤”)和百姓从耶路撒冷掳去，末底改也在其内。 Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 末底改抚养他叔叔的女儿哈大沙(后名以斯帖)，因为她没有父母。这女子又容貌俊美，她父母死了，末底改就收她为自己的女儿。 And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 王的谕旨传出，就招聚许多女子到书珊城，交给掌管女子的希该，以斯帖也送入王宫，交付希该。 So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 希该喜悦以斯帖，就恩待她，急忙给她需用的香品和她所当得的分，又派所当得的七个宫女服事她，使她和她的宫女搬入女院上好的房屋。 And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 以斯帖未曾将籍贯宗族告诉人，因为末底改嘱咐她不可叫人知道。 Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 末底改天天在女院前边行走，要知道以斯帖平安不平安，并后事如何。 And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 众女子照例先洁净身体十二个月：六个月用没药油，六个月用香料和洁身之物。满了日期，然后挨次进去见亚哈随鲁王。 Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 女子进去见王是这样：从女院到王宫的时候，凡她所要的，都必给她。 Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 晚上进去，次日回到女子第二院，交给掌管妃嫔的太监沙甲。除非王喜爱她，再提名召她，就不再进去见王。 In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 末底改叔叔亚比孩的女儿，就是末底改收为自己女儿的以斯帖，按次序当进去见王的时候，除了掌管女子的太监希该所派定给她的，她别无所求。凡看见以斯帖的都喜悦她。 Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 亚哈随鲁王第七年十月，就是提别月，以斯帖被引入宫见王。 So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 王爱以斯帖过于爱众女，她在王眼前蒙宠爱比众处女更甚。王就把王后的冠冕戴在她头上，立她为王后，代替瓦实提。 And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 王因以斯帖的缘故给众首领和臣仆设摆大筵席，又豁免各省的租税，并照王的厚意大颁赏赐。 Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 第二次招聚处女的时候，末底改坐在朝门。 And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 以斯帖照着末底改所嘱咐的，还没有将籍贯宗族告诉人；因为以斯帖遵末底改的命，如抚养她的时候一样。 Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 当那时候，末底改坐在朝门，王的太监中有两个守门的辟探和提列，恼恨亚哈随鲁王，想要下手害他。 In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 末底改知道了，就告诉王后以斯帖。以斯帖奉末底改的名，报告于王。 And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 究察这事，果然是实，就把二人挂在木头上，将这事在王面前写于历史上。 And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor17_3">以斯帖记 3</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 这事以后，亚哈随鲁王抬举亚甲族哈米大他的儿子哈曼，使他高升，叫他的爵位超过与他同事的一切臣宰。 After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 在朝门的一切臣仆，都跪拜哈曼，因为王如此吩咐，惟独末底改不跪不拜。 And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 在朝门的臣仆问末底改说：“你为何违背王的命令呢？” Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他们天天劝他，他还是不听，他们就告诉哈曼，要看末底改的事站得住站不住，因他已经告诉他们自己是犹大人。 Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 哈曼见末底改不跪不拜，他就怒气填胸。 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他们已将末底改的本族告诉哈曼，他以为下手害末底改一人是小事，就要灭绝亚哈随鲁王通国所有的犹大人，就是末底改的本族。 And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 亚哈随鲁王十二年正月，就是尼散月，人在哈曼面前，按日日月月掣普珥，就是掣签，要定何月何日为吉，择定了十二月，就是亚达月。 In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 哈曼对亚哈随鲁王说：“有一种民，散居在王国各省的民中，他们的律例，与万民的律例不同；也不守王的律例，所以容留他们与王无益。 And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 王若以为美，请下旨意灭绝他们。我就捐一万他连得银子，交给掌管国帑的人，纳入王的府库。” If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 于是王从自己手上摘下戒指，给犹大人的仇敌，亚甲族哈米大他的儿子哈曼。 And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 王对哈曼说：“这银子仍赐给你，这民也交给你，你可以随意待他们。” And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 正月十三日，就召了王的书记来，照着哈曼一切所吩咐的，用各省的文字，各族的方言，奉亚哈随鲁王的名写旨意，传与总督和各省的省长，并各族的首领。又用王的戒指盖印， Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 交给驿卒传到王的各省，吩咐将犹大人，无论老少妇女孩子，在一日之间，十二月，就是亚达月十三日，全然剪除，杀戮灭绝，并夺他们的财为掠物。 And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 抄录这旨意，颁行各省，宣告各族，使他们预备等候那日。 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 驿卒奉王命急忙起行，旨意也传遍书珊城。王同哈曼坐下饮酒，书珊城的民，却都慌乱。 The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor17_4">以斯帖记 4</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 末底改知道所作的这一切事，就撕裂衣服，穿麻衣，蒙灰尘，在城中行走，痛哭哀号。 When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 到了朝门前停住脚步因为穿麻衣的不可进朝门。 And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 王的谕旨所到的各省各处，犹大人大大悲哀，禁食哭泣哀号，穿麻衣躺在灰中的甚多。 And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 王后以斯帖的宫女和太监来把这事告诉以斯帖，她甚是忧愁，就送衣服给末底改穿；要他脱下麻衣，他却不受。 So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 以斯帖就把王所派伺候她的一个太监，名叫哈他革召来，吩咐他去见末底改，要知道这是什么事，是什么缘故。 Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 于是哈他革出到朝门前的宽阔处见末底改。 So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 末底改将自己所遇的事，并哈曼为灭绝犹大人，应许捐入王库的银数，都告诉了他。 And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 又将所抄写传遍书珊城要灭绝犹大人的旨意交给哈他革，要给以斯帖看。又要给她说明，并嘱咐她进去见王，为本族的人，在王面前恳切祈求。 Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 哈他革回来，将末底改的话告诉以斯帖。 And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 以斯帖就吩咐哈他革去见末底改说： Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: “王的一切臣仆和各省的人民，都知道有一个定例：若不蒙召，擅入内院见王的，无论男女必被治死；除非王向他伸出金杖，不得存活。现在我没有蒙召进去见王已经三十日了。” All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 人就把以斯帖这话告诉末底改。 And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 末底改托人回复以斯帖说：“你莫想在王宫里强过一切犹大人，得免这祸。 Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 此时你若闭口不言，犹大人必从别处得解脱，蒙拯救；你和你父家，必致灭亡。焉知你得了王后的位分，不是为现今的机会吗？” For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 以斯帖就吩咐人回报末底改说： Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: “你当去招聚书珊城所有的犹大人，为我禁食三昼三夜，不吃不喝；我和我的宫女，也要这样禁食。然后我违例进去见王，我若死就死吧！” Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 于是末底改照以斯帖一切所吩咐的去行。 So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor17_5">以斯帖记 5</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 第三日，以斯帖穿上朝服，进王宫的内院，对殿站立。王在殿里坐在宝座上，对着殿门。 Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 王见王后以斯帖站在院内，就施恩于她，向她伸出手中的金杖，以斯帖便向前摸杖头。 And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 王对她说：“王后以斯帖啊！你要什么？你求什么？就是国的一半也必赐给你。” Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 以斯帖说：“王若以为美，就请王带着哈曼今日赴我所预备的筵席。” And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 王说：“叫哈曼速速照以斯帖的话去行。”于是王带着哈曼赴以斯帖所预备的筵席。 Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 在酒席筵前，王又问以斯帖说：“你要什么？我必赐给你；你求什么？就是国的一半也必为你成就。” And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 以斯帖回答说：“我有所要，我有所求。 Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 我若在王眼前蒙恩，王若愿意赐我所要的，准我所求的，就请王带着哈曼再赴我所要预备的筵席。明日我必照王所问的说明。” If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 那日哈曼心中快乐，欢欢喜喜地出来。但见末底改在朝门不站起来，连身也不动，就满心恼怒末底改。 Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 哈曼暂且忍耐回家，叫人请他朋友和他妻子细利斯来。 Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 哈曼将他富厚的荣耀，众多的儿女，和王抬举他使他超乎首领臣仆之上，都述说给他们听。 And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 哈曼又说：“王后以斯帖预备筵席，除了我之外不许别人随王赴席。明日王后又请我随王赴席； Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 只是我见犹大人末底改坐在朝门，虽有这一切荣耀，也与我无益。” Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他的妻细利斯和他一切的朋友对他说：“不如立一个五丈高的木架，明早求王将末底改挂在其上，然后你可以欢欢喜喜地随王赴席。”哈曼以这话为美，就叫人作了木架。 Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor17_6">以斯帖记 6</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 那夜王睡不着觉，就吩咐人取历史来，念给他听。 On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 正遇见书上写着说：“王的太监中有两个守门的，辟探和提列，想要下手害亚哈随鲁王，末底改将这事告诉王后。” And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 王说：“末底改行了这事，赐他什么尊荣爵位没有？”伺候王的臣仆回答说：“没有赐他什么。” And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 王说：“谁在院子里？”(那时哈曼正进王宫的外院，要求王将末底改挂在他所预备的木架上。) And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 臣仆说：“哈曼站在院内。”王说：“叫他进来！” And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 哈曼就进去。王问他说：“王所喜悦尊荣的人，当如何待他呢？”哈曼心里说：“王所喜悦尊荣的，不是我是谁呢？” So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 哈曼就回答说：“王所喜悦尊荣的人， And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 当将王常穿的朝服和戴冠的御马， Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 都交给王极尊贵的一个大臣，命他将衣服给王所喜悦尊荣的人穿上，使他骑上马，走遍城里的街市，在他面前宣告说：王所喜悦尊荣的人，就如此待他。” And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 王对哈曼说：“你速速将这衣服和马，照你所说的，向坐在朝门的犹大人末底改去行。凡你所说的，一样不可缺。” Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 于是哈曼将朝服给末底改穿上，使他骑上马走遍城里的街市，在他面前宣告说：“王所喜悦尊荣的人，就如此待他。” Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 末底改仍回到朝门，哈曼却忧忧闷闷地蒙着头，急忙回家去了， And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 将所遇的一切事，详细说给他的妻细利斯和他的众朋友听。他的智慧人和他的妻细利斯对他说：“你在末底改面前始而败落，他如果是犹大人，你必不能胜他，终必在他面前败落。” And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他们还与哈曼说话的时候，王的太监来催哈曼快去赴以斯帖所预备的筵席。 And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor17_7">以斯帖记 7</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 王带着哈曼来赴王后以斯帖的筵席。 So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 这第二次在酒席筵前，王又问以斯帖说：“王后以斯帖啊！你要什么？我必赐给你；你求什么？就是国的一半，也必为你成就。” And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 王后以斯帖回答说：“我若在王眼前蒙恩，王若以为美，我所愿的，是愿王将我的性命赐给我；我所求的，是求王将我的本族赐给我。 Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 因我和我的本族被卖了，要剪除杀戮灭绝我们。我们若被卖为奴为婢，我也闭口不言；但王的损失，敌人万不能补足。” For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 亚哈随鲁王问王后以斯帖说：“擅敢起意如此行的是谁？这人在哪里呢？” Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 以斯帖说：“仇人敌人就是这恶人哈曼。”哈曼在王和王后面前就甚惊惶。 And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 王便大怒，起来离开酒席往御园去了。哈曼见王定意要加罪与他，就起来，求王后以斯帖救命。 And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 王从御园回到酒席之处，见哈曼伏在以斯帖所靠的榻上；王说：“他竟敢在宫内，在我面前，凌辱王后吗？”这话一出王口；人就蒙了哈曼的脸。 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 伺候王的一个太监，名叫哈波拿，说：“哈曼为那救王有功的末底改，作了五丈高的木架，现今立在哈曼家里。”王说：“把哈曼挂在其上。” And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 于是人将哈曼挂在他为末底改所预备的木架上。王的忿怒这才止息。 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor17_8">以斯帖记 8</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 当日，亚哈随鲁王把犹大人仇敌哈曼的家产赐给王后以斯帖。末底改也来到王面前，因为以斯帖已经告诉王末底改是她的亲属。 On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 王摘下自己的戒指，就是从哈曼追回的，给了末底改。以斯帖派末底改管理哈曼的家产。 And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 以斯帖又俯伏在王脚前，流泪哀告，求他除掉亚甲族哈曼害犹大人的恶谋。 And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 王向以斯帖伸出金杖；以斯帖就起来，站在王前， Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther.
