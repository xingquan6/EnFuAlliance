And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 这人名叫以利米勒。他的妻名叫拿俄米。他两个儿子，一个名叫玛伦，一个名叫基连，都是犹大伯利恒的以法他人。他们到了摩押地就住在那里。 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 后来拿俄米的丈夫以利米勒死了，剩下妇人和她两个儿子。 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 这两个儿子娶了摩押女子为妻，一个名叫俄珥巴，一个名叫路得，在那里住了约有十年。 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 玛伦和基连二人也死了，剩下拿俄米没有丈夫，也没有儿子。 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 她就与两个儿妇起身要从摩押地归回，因为她在摩押地，听见耶和华眷顾自己的百姓，赐粮食与他们。 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 于是她和两个儿妇起行离开所住的地方，要回犹大地去。 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 拿俄米对两个儿妇说：“你们各人回娘家去吧！愿耶和华恩待你们，象你们恩待已死的人与我一样。 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 愿耶和华使你们各在新夫家中得平安。”于是，拿俄米与她们亲嘴。她们就放声而哭， The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 说：“不然！我们必与你一同回你本国去。” And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 拿俄米说：“我女儿们哪！回去吧！为何要跟我去呢？我还能生子作你们的丈夫吗？ And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 我女儿们哪！回去吧！我年纪老迈，不能再有丈夫；即或说，我还有指望，今夜有丈夫可以生子， Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 你们岂能等着他们长大呢？你们岂能等着他们不嫁别人呢？我女儿们哪！不要这样，我为你们的缘故，甚是愁苦，因为耶和华伸手攻击我。” Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 两个儿妇又放声而哭，俄珥巴与婆婆亲嘴而别，只是路得舍不得拿俄米。 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 拿俄米说：“看哪！你嫂子已经回她本国和她所拜的神那里去了，你也跟着你嫂子回去吧！” And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 路得说：“不要催我回去不跟随你。你往哪里去，我也往哪里去；你在哪里住宿，我也在哪里住宿；你的国就是我的国，你的　神就是我的　神； And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 你在哪里死，我也在哪里死，也葬在那里。除非死能使你我相离，不然，愿耶和华重重地降罚与我！” Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 拿俄米见路得定意要跟随自己去，就不再劝她了。 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 于是二人同行，来到伯利恒。她们到了伯利恒，合城的人就都惊讶。妇女们说：“这是拿俄米吗？” So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 拿俄米对他们说：“不要叫我拿俄米(“拿俄米”就是“甜”的意思)，要叫我玛拉(“玛拉”就是“苦”的意思)，因为全能者使我受了大苦。 And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 我满满地出去，耶和华使我空空地回来。耶和华降祸与我，全能者使我受苦，既是这样，你们为何还叫我拿俄米呢？” I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 拿俄米和她儿妇摩押女子路得，从摩押地回来到伯利恒，正是动手割大麦的时候。 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor8_2">路得记 2</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 拿俄米的丈夫以利米勒的亲族中，有一个人名叫波阿斯，是个大财主。 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 摩押女子路得对拿俄米说：“容我往田间去，我蒙谁的恩，就在谁的身后拾取麦穗。”拿俄米说：“女儿啊！你只管去。” And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 路得就去了，来到田间，在收割的人身后拾取麦穗。她恰巧到了以利米勒本族的人波阿斯那块田里。 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 波阿斯正从伯利恒来，对收割的人说：“愿耶和华与你们同在。”他们回答说：“愿耶和华赐福与你。” And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 波阿斯问监管收割的仆人说：“那是谁家的女子？” Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 监管收割的仆人回答说：“是那摩押女子，跟随拿俄米从摩押地回来的。 And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 她说：‘请你容我跟着收割的人，拾取打捆剩下的麦穗。’她从早晨直到如今，除了在屋子里坐一会儿，常在这里。” And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 波阿斯对路得说：“女儿啊！听我说：不要往别人田里拾取麦穗，也不要离开这里，要常与我使女们在一处。 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 我的仆人在哪块田收割，你就跟着他们去。我已经吩咐仆人不可欺负你。你若渴了，就可以到器皿那里喝仆人打来的水。” Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 路得就俯伏在地叩拜，对他说：“我既是外邦人，怎么蒙你的恩，这样顾恤我呢？” Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 波阿斯回答说：“自从你丈夫死后，凡你向婆婆所行的，并你离开父母和本地，到素不认识的民中，这些事人全都告诉我了。 And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 愿耶和华照你所行的赏赐你。你来投靠耶和华以色列　神的翅膀下，愿你满得他的赏赐。” The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 路得说：“我主啊！愿在你眼前蒙恩，我虽然不及你的一个使女，你还用慈爱的话安慰我的心。” Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 到了吃饭的时候，波阿斯对路得说：“你到这里来吃饼，将饼蘸在醋里。”路得就在收割的人旁边坐下，他们把烘了的穗子递给她，她吃饱了，还有余剩的。 And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 她起来又拾取麦穗，波阿斯吩咐仆人说：“她就是在捆中拾取麦穗，也可以容她，不可羞辱她。 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 并要从捆里抽出些来，留在地下，任她拾取，不可叱吓她。” And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 这样，路得在田间拾取麦穗，直到晚上，将所拾取的打了约有一伊法大麦。 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 她就把所拾取的带进城去，给婆婆看。又把她吃饱了所剩的给了婆婆。 And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 婆婆问她说：“你今日在哪里拾取麦穗，在哪里作工呢？愿那顾恤你的得福。”路得就告诉婆婆说：“我今日在一个名叫波阿斯的人那里作工。” And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 拿俄米对儿妇说：“愿那人蒙耶和华赐福，因为他不断地恩待活人死人。”拿俄米又说：“那是我们本族的人，是一个至近的亲属。” And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 摩押女子路得说：“他对我说：‘你要紧随我的仆人拾取麦穗，直等他们收完了我的庄稼。’” And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 拿俄米对儿妇路得说：“女儿啊！你跟着他的使女出去，不叫人遇见你在别人田间，这才为好。” And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 于是，路得与波阿斯的使女，常在一处拾取麦穗，直到收完了大麦和小麦。路得仍与婆婆同住。 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor8_3">路得记 3</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 路得的婆婆拿俄米对她说：“女儿啊！我不当为你找个安身之处，使你享福吗？ Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 你与波阿斯的使女常在一处，波阿斯不是我们的亲族吗？他今夜在场上簸大麦， And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 你要沐浴抹膏，换上衣服，下到场上，却不要使那人认出你来。你等他吃喝完了， Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 到他睡的时候，你看准他睡的地方，就进去掀开他脚上的被，躺卧在那里，他必告诉你所当作的事。” And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 路得说：“凡你所吩咐的，我必遵行。” And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 路得就下到场上，照她婆婆所吩咐她的而行。 And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 波阿斯吃喝完了，心里欢畅，就去睡在麦堆旁边。路得便悄悄地来掀开他脚上的被，躺卧在那里。 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 到了夜半，那人忽然惊醒，翻过身来，不料有女子躺在他的脚下。 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他就说：“你是谁？”回答说：“我是你的婢女路得。求你用你的衣襟遮盖我，因为你是我一个至近的亲属。” And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 波阿斯说：“女儿啊！愿你蒙耶和华赐福。你末后的恩，比先前更大；因为少年人无论贫富，你都没有跟从。 And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 女儿啊！现在不要惧怕，凡你所说的，我必照着行，我本城的人都知道你是个贤德的女子。 And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 我实在是你一个至近的亲属，只是还有一个人比我更近。 And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 你今夜在这里住宿，明早他若肯为你尽亲属的本分，就由他吧！倘若不肯，我指着永生的耶和华起誓，我必为你尽了本分，你只管躺到天亮。” Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 路得便在他脚下躺到天快亮，人彼此不能辨认的时候，就起来了。波阿斯说：“不可使人知道有女子到场上来。” And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 又对路得说：“打开你所披的外衣。”她打开了，波阿斯就撮了六簸箕大麦，帮她扛在肩上，她便进城去了。 Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 路得回到婆婆那里，婆婆说：“女儿啊！怎么样了。”路得就将那人向她所行的述说了一遍。 And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 又说：“那人给了我六簸箕大麦，对我说：‘你不可空手回去见你的婆婆。’” And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 婆婆说：“女儿啊！你只管安坐等候，看这事怎样成就，因为那人今日不办成这事必不休息。” Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor8_4">路得记 4</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 波阿斯到了城门，坐在那里，恰巧波阿斯所说的那至近的亲属经过。波阿斯说：“某人哪！你来坐在这里。”他就来坐下。 Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 波阿斯又从本城的长老中拣选了十人，对他们说：“请你们坐在这里。”他们就都坐下。 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 波阿斯对那至近的亲属说：“从摩押地回来的拿俄米，现在要卖我们族兄以利米勒的那块地。 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 我想当赎那块地的是你，其次是我，以外再没有别人了。你可以在这里的人面前，和我本国的长老面前说明，你若肯赎就赎，若不肯赎就告诉我。”那人回答说：“我肯赎。” And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 波阿斯说：“你从拿俄米手中买这地的时候，也当娶(原文作“买”十节同)死人的妻摩押女子路得，使死人在产业上存留他的名。” Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 那人说：“这样我就不能赎了，恐怕于我的产业有碍。你可以赎我所当赎的，我不能赎了。” And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 从前，在以色列中要定夺什么事，或赎回，或交易，这人就脱鞋给那人。以色列人都以此为证据。 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 那人对波阿斯说：“你自己买吧！”于是将鞋脱下来了。 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his shoe.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 波阿斯对长老和众民说：“你们今日作见证，凡属以利米勒和基连、玛伦的，我都从拿俄米手中置买了； And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 又娶了玛伦的妻摩押女子路得为妻，好在死人的产业上存留他的名，免得他的名在本族本乡灭没。你们今日可以作见证。” Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 在城门坐着的众民和长老都说：“我们作见证。愿耶和华使进你家的这女子，象建立以色列家的拉结、利亚二人一样。又愿你在以法他得亨通，在伯利恒得名声。 And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 愿耶和华从这少年女子赐你后裔，使你的家象他玛从犹大所生法勒斯的家一般。” And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 于是波阿斯娶了路得为妻，与她同房。耶和华使她怀孕生了一个儿子。 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 妇人们对拿俄米说：“耶和华是应当称颂的！因为今日没有撇下你使你无至近的亲属。愿这孩子在以色列中得名声。 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 他必提起你的精神，奉养你的老，因为是爱慕你的那儿妇所生的；有这儿妇比有七个儿子还好。” And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 拿俄米就把孩子抱在怀中，作他的养母。 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 邻舍的妇人说：“拿俄米得孩子了！”就给孩子起名叫俄备得。这俄备得是耶西的父，耶西是大卫的父。 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 法勒斯的后代记在下面：法勒斯生希斯仑； Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 希斯仑生兰；兰生亚米拿达； And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 亚米拿达生拿顺；拿顺生撒门； And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 撒门生波阿斯；波阿斯生俄备得； And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 俄备得生耶西；耶西生大卫。 And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.</p>
