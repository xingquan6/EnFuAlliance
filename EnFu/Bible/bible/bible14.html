margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 所罗门吩咐以色列众人，就是千夫长、百夫长、审判官、首领与族长都来。 Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 所罗门和会众都往基遍的邱坛去，因那里有　神的会幕，就是耶和华仆人摩西在旷野所制造的。 So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 只是　神的约柜，大卫已经从基列耶琳搬到他所预备的地方，因他曾在耶路撒冷为约柜支搭了帐幕。 But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 并且户珥的孙子乌利的儿子比撒列所造的铜坛，也在基遍耶和华的会幕前。所罗门和会众都就近坛前。 Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 所罗门上到耶和华面前会幕的铜坛那里，献一千牺牲为燔祭。 And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 当夜，　神向所罗门显现，对他说：“你愿我赐你什么，你可以求。” In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 所罗门对　神说：“你曾向我父大卫大施慈爱，使我接续他作王。 And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 耶和华　神啊！现在求你成就向我父大卫所应许的话，因你立我作这民的王，他们如同地上尘沙那样多。 Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 求你赐我智慧聪明，我好在这民前出入；不然，谁能判断这众多的民呢？” Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 　神对所罗门说：“我已立你作我民的王。你既有这心意，并不求资财丰富尊荣，也不求灭绝那恨你之人的性命，又不求大寿数，只求智慧聪明好判断我的民： And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 我必赐你智慧聪明，也必赐你资财丰富尊荣。在你以前的列王，都没有这样；在你以后也必没有这样的。” Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 于是所罗门从基遍邱坛会幕前，回到耶路撒冷，治理以色列人。 Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 所罗门聚集战车马兵：有战车一千四百辆，马兵一万二千名，安置在屯车的城邑和耶路撒冷，就是王那里。 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 王在耶路撒冷使金银多如石头，香柏木多如高原的桑树。 And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 所罗门的马是从埃及带来的，是王的商人一群一群按着定价买来的。 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 他们从埃及买来的车，每辆价银六百舍客勒；马每匹一百五十舍客勒。赫人诸王和亚兰诸王所买的车马，也是按这价值经他们手买来的。 And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_2">历代志下 2</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 所罗门定意要为耶和华的名建造殿宇，又为自己的国建造宫室。 And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 所罗门就挑选七万扛抬的，八万在山上凿石头的，三千六百督工的。 And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 所罗门差人去见推罗王希兰说：“你曾运香柏木与我父大卫建宫居住，求你也这样待我。 And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 我要为耶和华我　神的名建造殿宇，分别为圣献给他，在他面前焚烧美香，常摆陈设饼，每早晚、安息日、月朔，并耶和华我们　神所定的节期献燔祭。这是以色列人永远的定例。 Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 我所要建造的殿宇甚大，因为我们的　神至大，超乎诸神。 And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 天和天上的天，尚且不足他居住的，谁能为他建造殿宇呢？我是谁，能为他建造殿宇吗？不过在他面前烧香而已。 But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 现在求你差一个巧匠来，就是善用金、银、铜、铁，和紫色朱红色蓝色线，并精于雕刻之工的巧匠，与我父大卫在犹大和耶路撒冷所预备的巧匠一同作工。 Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 又求你从黎巴嫩运些香柏木、松木、檀香木到我这里来；因我知道你的仆人善于砍伐黎巴嫩的树木。我的仆人也必与你的仆人同工。 Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 这样，可以给我预备许多的木料，因我要建造的殿宇，高大出奇。 Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 你的仆人砍伐树木，我必给他们打好了的小麦二万歌珥，大麦二万歌珥，酒二万罢特，油二万罢特。” And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 推罗王希兰写信回答所罗门说：“耶和华因为爱他的子民，所以立你作他们的王。” Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 又说：“创造天地的耶和华以色列的　神，是应当称颂的！他赐给大卫王一个有智慧的儿子，使他有谋略聪明，可以为耶和华建造殿宇，又为自己的国建造宫室。 Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 现在我打发一个精巧有聪明的人去，他是我父亲希兰所用的， And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 是但支派一个妇人的儿子。他父亲是推罗人，他善用金、银、铜、铁、石、木，和紫色蓝色朱红色线，与细麻，制造各物，并精于雕刻，又能想出各样的巧工。请你派定这人，与你的巧匠和你父我主大卫的巧匠，一同作工。 The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 我主所说的小麦、大麦、酒、油，愿我主运来给众仆人。 Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 我们必照你所需用的，从黎巴嫩砍伐树木，扎成筏子，浮海运到约帕，你可以从那里运到耶路撒冷。” And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 所罗门仿照他父大卫数点住在以色列地所有寄居的外邦人，共有十五万三千六百名。 And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 使七万人扛抬材料，八万人在山上凿石头，三千六百人督理工作。 And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_3">历代志下 3</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 所罗门就在耶路撒冷，耶和华向他父大卫显现的摩利亚山上，就是耶布斯人阿珥楠的禾场上，大卫所指定的地方，预备好了，开工建造耶和华的殿。 Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 所罗门作王第四年，二月初二日开工建造。 And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 所罗门建筑　神殿的根基，乃是这样：长六十肘，宽二十肘，都按着古时的尺寸。 Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 殿前的廊子长二十肘，与殿的宽窄一样，高一百二十肘；里面贴上精金。 And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 大殿的墙，都用松木板遮蔽，又贴了精金，上面雕刻棕树和链子； And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 又用宝石装饰殿墙，使殿华美。所用的金子，都是巴瓦音的金子。 And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 又用金子贴殿和殿的栋梁、门槛、墙壁、门扇，墙上雕刻基路伯。 He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 又建造至圣所，长二十肘，与殿的宽窄一样，宽也是二十肘；贴上精金，共用金子六百他连得。 And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 金钉重五十舍客勒。楼房都贴上金子。 And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold.

So the house of the LORD was perfected.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 那时，所罗门往以东地靠海的以旬迦别和以禄去。 Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 希兰差遣他的臣仆，将船只和熟悉泛海的仆人，送到所罗门那里。他们同着所罗门的仆人到了俄斐，得了四百五十他连得金子，运到所罗门王那里。 And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_9">历代志下 9</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 示巴女王听见所罗门的名声，就来到耶路撒冷，要用难解的话试问所罗门。跟随她的人甚多，又有骆驼驮着香料、宝石和许多金子。她来见了所罗门，就把心里所有的，对所罗门都说出来。 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 所罗门将她所问的都答上了，没有一句不明白，不能答的。 And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 示巴女王见所罗门的智慧和他所建造的宫室， And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 席上的珍馐美味，群臣分列而坐，仆人两旁侍立，以及他们的衣服装饰，酒政和酒政的衣服装饰，又见他上耶和华殿的台阶，就诧异得神不守舍。 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 对王说：“我在本国里所听见论到你的事和你的智慧，实在是真的。 And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 我先不信那些话，及至我来亲眼见了，才知道你的大智慧，人所告诉我的，还不到一半；你的实迹，越过我所听见的名声。 Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame that I heard.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 你的群臣，你的仆人，常侍立在你面前，听你智慧的话，是有福的。 Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 耶和华你的　神是应当称颂的！他喜悦你，使你坐他的国位，为耶和华你的　神作王；因为你的　神爱以色列人，要永远坚立他们，所以立你作他们的王，使你秉公行义。” Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 于是示巴女王将一百二十他连得金子和宝石，与极多的香料送给所罗门王。她送给王的香料，以后再没有这样的。 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 希兰的仆人和所罗门的仆人，从俄斐运了金子来，也运了檀香木(或作“乌木。”下同。)和宝石来。 And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 王用檀香木为耶和华殿和王宫作台，又为歌唱的人作琴瑟；犹大地从来没有见过这样的。 And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 所罗门王按示巴女王所带来的还她礼物，另外照她一切所要所求的，都送给她。于是女王和她臣仆转回本国去了。 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 所罗门每年所得的金子，共有六百六十六他连得。 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 另外还有商人所进的金子，并且阿拉伯诸王与属国的省长，都带金银给所罗门。 Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought.

So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: “你父亲使我们负重轭作苦工，现在求你使我们作的苦工负的重轭轻松些，我们就事奉你。” Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 罗波安对他们说：“第三日再来见我吧！”民就去了。 And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 罗波安之父所罗门在世的日子，有侍立在他面前的老年人，罗波安王和他们商议，说：“你们给我出个什么主意，我好回复这民。” And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 老年人对他说：“王若恩待这民，使他们喜悦，用好话回复他们，他们就永远作王的仆人。” And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 王却不用老年人给他出的主意，就和那些与他一同长大、在他面前侍立的少年人商议， But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 说：“这民对我说，你父亲使我们负重轭，求你使我们轻松些。你们给我出个什么主意，我好回复他们。” And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 那同他长大的少年人说：“这民对王说，你父亲使我们负重轭，求你使我们轻松些。王要对他们如此说：我的小拇指比我父亲的腰还粗， And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 我父亲使你们负重轭，我必使你们负更重的轭；我父亲用鞭子责打你们，我要用蝎子鞭责打你们。” For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 耶罗波安和众百姓遵着罗波安王所说，你们第三日再来见我的那话，第三日他们果然来了。 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 罗波安王用严厉的话回复他们，不用老年人所出的主意， And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 照着少年人所出的主意对他们说：“我父亲使你们负重轭，我必使你们负更重的轭；我父亲用鞭子责打你们，我要用蝎子鞭责打你们。” And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 王不肯依从百姓；这事乃出于　神，为要应验耶和华藉示罗人亚希雅对尼八儿子耶罗波安所说的话。 So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 以色列众民见王不依从他们，就对王说：“我们与大卫有什么分儿呢？与耶西的儿子并没有关涉！以色列人哪！各回各家去吧！大卫家啊！自己顾自己吧！”于是以色列众人都回自己家里去了。 And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thine own house.

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 这国攻击那国，这城攻击那城，互相破坏，因为　神用各样灾难扰乱他们。 And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 现在你们要刚强，不要手软，因你们所行的必得赏赐。” Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 亚撒听见这话和俄德儿子先知亚撒利雅的预言，就壮起胆来，在犹大、便雅悯全地，并以法莲山地所夺的各城，将可憎之物尽都除掉；又在耶和华殿的廊前，重新修筑耶和华的坛。 And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 又招聚犹大、便雅悯的众人，并他们中间寄居的以法莲人、玛拿西人、西缅人；有许多以色列人归降亚撒，因见耶和华他的　神与他同在。 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 亚撒十五年三月，他们都聚集在耶路撒冷。 So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 当日他们从所取的掳物中，将牛七百只，羊七千只，献给耶和华。 And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他们就立约，要尽心尽性地寻求耶和华他们列祖的　神。 And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 凡不寻求耶和华以色列　神的，无论大小、男女，必被治死。 That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他们就大声欢呼，吹号、吹角，向耶和华起誓。 And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 犹大众人为所起的誓欢喜，因他们是尽心起誓，尽意寻求耶和华，耶和华就被他们寻见，且赐他们四境平安。 And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 亚撒王贬了他祖母玛迦太后的位，因她造了可憎的偶像亚舍拉。亚撒砍下她的偶像，捣得粉碎，烧在汲沦溪边。 And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 只是邱坛还没有从以色列中废去，然而亚撒的心一生诚实。 But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 亚撒将他父所分别为圣，与自己所分别为圣的金银和器皿，都奉到　神的殿里。 And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 从这时，直到亚撒三十五年，都没有争战的事。 And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_16">历代志下 16</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 亚撒三十六年，以色列王巴沙上来攻击犹大，修筑拉玛，不许人从犹大王亚撒那里出入。 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 于是亚撒从耶和华殿和王宫的府库里，拿出金银来，送与住大马色的亚兰王便哈达，说： Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: “你父曾与我父立约，我与你也要立约。现在我将金银送给你，求你废掉你与以色列王巴沙所立的约，使他离开我。” There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 便哈达听从亚撒王的话，派军长去攻击以色列的城邑。他们就攻破以云、但、亚伯玛音，和拿弗他利一切的积货城。 And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 巴沙听见就停工，不修筑拉玛了。 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 于是亚撒王率领犹大众人，将巴沙修筑拉玛所用的石头、木头都运去，用以修筑迦巴和米斯巴。 Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 那时，先见哈拿尼来见犹大王亚撒，对他说：“因你仰赖亚兰王，没有仰赖耶和华你的　神，所以亚兰王的军兵脱离了你的手。 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 古实人、路比人的军队不是甚大吗？战车马兵不是极多吗？只因你仰赖耶和华，他便将他们交在你手里。 Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 耶和华的眼目遍察全地，要显大能帮助向他心存诚实的人。你这事行得愚昧。此后，你必有争战的事。” For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 亚撒因此恼恨先见，将他囚在监里。那时亚撒也虐待一些人民。 Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 亚撒所行的事，自始至终都写在犹大和以色列诸王记上。 And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 亚撒作王三十九年，他脚上有病，而且甚重；病的时候没有求耶和华，只求医生。 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他作王四十一年而死，与他列祖同睡， And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 葬在大卫城自己所凿的坟墓里，放在床上，其床堆满各样馨香的香料，就是按作香的作法调和的香料，又为他烧了许多的物件。 And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_17">历代志下 17</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 亚撒的儿子约沙法接续他作王，奋勇自强，防备以色列人。 And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 安置军兵在犹大一切坚固城里，又安置防兵在犹大地和他父亚撒所得以法莲的城邑中。 And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 耶和华与约沙法同在，因为他行他祖大卫初行的道，不寻求巴力， And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 只寻求他父亲的　神，遵行他的诫命，不效法以色列人的行为。 But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 所以耶和华坚定他的国，犹大众人给他进贡；约沙法大有尊荣资财。 Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他高兴遵行耶和华的道，并且从犹大除掉一切邱坛和木偶。 And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 他作王第三年，就差遣臣子便亥伊勒、俄巴底、撒迦利雅、拿坦业、米该亚，往犹大各城去教训百姓。 Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 同着他们有利未人示玛雅、尼探雅、西巴第雅、亚撒黑、示米拉末、约拿单、亚多尼雅、多比雅、驼巴多尼雅，又有祭司以利沙玛、约兰同着他们。 And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他们带着耶和华的律法书，走遍犹大各城教训百姓。 And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 耶和华使犹大四围的列国都甚恐惧，不敢与约沙法争战。 And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 有些非利士人与约沙法送礼物，纳贡银。阿拉伯人也送他公绵羊七千七百只，公山羊七千七百只。 Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 约沙法日渐强大，在犹大建造营寨和积货城。 And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他在犹大城邑中有许多工程。又在耶路撒冷有战士，就是大能的勇士。 And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他们的数目，按着宗族，记在下面：犹大族的千夫长押拿为首，率领大能的勇士三十万； And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 其次是千夫长约哈难，率领大能的勇士二十八万； And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 其次是细基利的儿子亚玛斯雅，他为耶和华牺牲自己，率领大能的勇士二十万； And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 便雅悯族，是大能的勇士以利雅大，率领拿弓箭和盾牌的二十万； And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 其次是约萨拔，率领预备打仗的十八万。 And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 这都是伺候王的，还有王在犹大全地坚固城所安置的不在其内。 These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_18">历代志下 18</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 约沙法大有尊荣资财，就与亚哈结亲。 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 过了几年，他下到撒玛利亚去见亚哈。亚哈为他和跟从他的人，宰了许多牛羊，劝他与自己同去攻取基列的拉末。 And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 以色列王亚哈问犹大王约沙法说：“你肯同我去攻取基列的拉末吗？”他回答说：“你我不分彼此，我的民与你的民一样，必与你同去争战。” And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 约沙法对以色列王说：“请你先求问耶和华。” And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 于是以色列王招聚先知四百人，问他们说：“我们上去攻取基列的拉末可以不可以？”他们说：“可以上去，因为　神必将那城交在王的手里。” Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 约沙法说：“这里不是还有耶和华的先知，我们可以求问他吗？” But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 以色列王对约沙法说：“还有一个人，是音拉的儿子米该雅，我们可以托他求问耶和华。只是我恨他，因为他指着我所说的预言，不说吉语，常说凶言。”约沙法说：“王不必这样说。” And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 以色列王就召了一个太监来，说：“你快去将音拉的儿子米该雅召来。” And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 以色列王和犹大王约沙法，在撒玛利亚城门前的空场上，各穿朝服坐在位上，所有的先知都在他们面前说预言。 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 基拿拿的儿子西底家造了两个铁角，说：“耶和华如此说：你要用这角抵触亚兰人，直到将他们灭尽。” And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 所有的先知也都这样预言，说：“可以上基列的拉末去，必然得胜，因为耶和华必将那城交在王的手中。” And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 那去召米该雅的使者对米该雅说：“众先知一口同音地都向王说吉言，你不如与他们说一样的话，也说吉言。” And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 米该雅说：“我指着永生的耶和华起誓，我的　神说什么，我就说什么。” And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 米该雅到王面前，王问他说：“米该雅啊！我们上去攻取基列的拉末可以不可以？”他说：“可以上去，必然得胜，敌人必交在你们手里。” And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 王对他说：“我当嘱咐你几次，你才奉耶和华的名向我说实话呢？” And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 米该雅说：“我看见以色列众民散在山上，如同没有牧人的羊群一般。耶和华说：‘这民没有主人，他们可以平平安安地各归各家去。’” Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 以色列王对约沙法说：“我岂没有告诉你，这人指着我所说的预言，不说吉语单说凶言吗？” And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 米该雅说：“你们要听耶和华的话，我看见耶和华坐在宝座上，天上的万军侍立在他左右。 Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 耶和华说：‘谁去引诱以色列王亚哈上基列的拉末去阵亡呢？’这个就这样说，那个就那样说。 And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 随后，有一个神灵出来，站在耶和华面前说：‘我去引诱他。’耶和华问他说：‘你用何法呢？’ Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 他说：‘我去，要在他众先知口中作谎言的灵。’耶和华说：‘这样，你必能引诱他，你去如此行吧！’ And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 现在耶和华使谎言的灵，入了你这些先知的口，并且耶和华已经命定降祸与你。” Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 基拿拿的儿子西底家前来打米该雅的脸，说：“耶和华的灵从哪里离开我与你说话呢？” Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 米该雅说：“你进严密的屋子藏躲的那日，就必看见了。” And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 以色列王说：“将米该雅带回，交给邑宰亚们和王的儿子约阿施，说： Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: ‘王如此说：把这个人下在监里，使他受苦，吃不饱喝不足，等候我平平安安地回来。’” And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 米该雅说：“你若能平安回来，那就是耶和华没有藉我说这话了。”又说：“众民哪！你们都要听。” And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 以色列王和犹大王约沙法，上基列的拉末去了。 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 以色列王对约沙法说：“我要改装上阵，你可以仍穿王服。”于是以色列王改装，他们就上阵去了。 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 先是亚兰王吩咐车兵长说：“他们的兵将，无论大小，你们都不可与他们争战，只要与以色列王争战。” Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 车兵长看见约沙法便说：“这必是以色列王。”就转过去与他争战。约沙法一呼喊，耶和华就帮助他，　神又感动他们离开他。 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 车兵长见不是以色列王，就转去不追他了。 For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 有一人随便开弓，恰巧射入以色列王的甲缝里。王对赶车的说：“我受了重伤，你转过车来，拉我出阵吧！” And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 那日阵势越战越猛，以色列王勉强站在车上抵挡亚兰人，直到晚上。约在日落的时候，王就死了。 And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_19">历代志下 19</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 犹大王约沙法平平安安地回耶路撒冷，到宫里去了。 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 先见哈拿尼的儿子耶户，出来迎接约沙法王，对他说：“你岂当帮助恶人，爱那恨恶耶和华的人呢？因此耶和华的忿怒临到你。 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 然而你还有善行，因你从国中除掉木偶，立定心意寻求　神。” Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 约沙法住在耶路撒冷，以后又出巡民间，从别是巴直到以法莲山地，引导民归向耶和华他们列祖的　神。 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 又在犹大国中遍地的坚固城里，设立审判官， And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 对他们说：“你们办事应当谨慎，因为你们判断，不是为人，乃是为耶和华；判断的时候，他必与你们同在。 And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 现在你们应当敬畏耶和华，谨慎办事，因为耶和华我们的　神没有不义，不偏待人，也不受贿赂。” Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 约沙法从利未人和祭司，并以色列族长中派定人，在耶路撒冷为耶和华判断，听民间的争讼，就回耶路撒冷去了。 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 约沙法嘱咐他们说：“你们当敬畏耶和华，忠心诚实办事。 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 住在各城里你们的弟兄，若有争讼的事，来到你们这里，或为流血，或犯律法、诫命、律例、典章，你们要警戒他们，免得他们得罪耶和华，以致他的忿怒临到你们和你们的弟兄；这样行，你们就没有罪了。 And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 凡属耶和华的事，有大祭司亚玛利雅管理你们；凡属王的事，有犹大支派的族长以实玛利的儿子西巴第雅管理你们。在你们面前有利未人作官长，你们应当壮胆办事，愿耶和华与善人同在。” And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you.

to morrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 约沙法就面伏于地，犹大众人和耶路撒冷的居民，也俯伏在耶和华面前，叩拜耶和华。 And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshipping the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 约沙法既与民商议了，就设立歌唱的人，颂赞耶和华，使他们穿上圣洁的礼服，走在军前赞美耶和华，说：“当称谢耶和华，因他的慈爱永远长存！” And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 众人方唱歌赞美的时候，耶和华就派伏兵击杀那来攻击犹大人的亚扪人、摩押人和西珥山人，他们就被打败了。 And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 因为亚扪人和摩押人起来，击杀住西珥山的人，将他们灭尽；灭尽住西珥山的人之后，他们又彼此自相击杀。 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 犹大人来到旷野的望楼，向那大军观看，见尸横遍地，没有一个逃脱的。 And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 第四日众人聚集在比拉迦(就是“称颂”的意思)谷，在那里称颂耶和华。因此，那地方名叫比拉迦谷，直到今日。 And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 犹大人和耶路撒冷人，都欢欢喜喜地回耶路撒冷，约沙法率领他们；因为耶和华使他们战胜仇敌，就欢喜快乐。 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 他们弹琴、鼓瑟、吹号，来到耶路撒冷，进了耶和华的殿。 And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 列邦诸国听见耶和华战败以色列的仇敌，就甚惧怕。 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 这样，约沙法的国得享太平，因为　神赐他四境平安。 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 约沙法作犹大王，登基的时候年三十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王二十五年。他母亲名叫阿苏巴，乃示利希的女儿。 And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 约沙法效法他父亚撒所行的，不偏左右，行耶和华眼中看为正的事。 And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 只是邱坛还没有废去，百姓也没有立定心意归向他们列祖的　神。 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 约沙法其余的事，自始至终，都写在哈拿尼的儿子耶户的书上，也载入以色列诸王记上。 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 此后，犹大王约沙法与以色列王亚哈谢交好，亚哈谢行恶太甚。 And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 二王合伙造船要往他施去，遂在以旬迦别造船。 And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongaber.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 那时，玛利沙人，多大瓦的儿子以利以谢，向约沙法预言说：“因你与亚哈谢交好，耶和华必破坏你所造的。”后来那船果然破坏，不能往他施去了。 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_21">历代志下 21</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 约沙法与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城他列祖的坟地里。他儿子约兰接续他作王。 Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 约兰有几个兄弟，就是约沙法的儿子亚撒利雅、耶歇、撒迦利雅、亚撒利雅、米迦勒、示法提雅，这都是以色列王约沙法的儿子。 And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 他们的父亲将许多金银、财宝，和犹大地的坚固城赐给他们；但将国赐给约兰，因为他是长子。 And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 约兰兴起坐他父的位，奋勇自强，就用刀杀了他的众兄弟和以色列的几个首领。 Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 约兰登基的时候年三十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王八年。 Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他行以色列诸王的道，与亚哈家一样，因他娶了亚哈的女儿为妻，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事。 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 耶和华却因自己与大卫所立的约，不肯灭大卫的家，照他所应许的，永远赐灯光与大卫和他的子孙。 Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 约兰年间以东人背叛犹大，脱离他的权下，自己立王。 In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 约兰就率领军长和所有的战车，夜间起来，攻击围困他的以东人和车兵长。 Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 这样，以东人背叛犹大，脱离他的权下，直到今日。那时，立拿人也背叛了，因为约兰离弃耶和华他列祖的　神。 So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 他又在犹大诸山建筑邱坛，使耶路撒冷的居民行邪淫，诱惑犹大人。 Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 先知以利亚达信与约兰，说：“耶和华你祖大卫的　神如此说：‘因为你不行你父约沙法和犹大王亚撒的道， And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 乃行以色列诸王的道，使犹大人和耶路撒冷的居民行邪淫，象亚哈家一样，又杀了你父家比你好的诸兄弟； But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better than thyself:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 故此，耶和华降大灾与你的百姓和你的妻子、儿女，并你一切所有的。 Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 你的肠子必患病，日加沉重，以致你的肠子坠落下来。’” And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 以后，耶和华激动非利士人和靠近古实的阿拉伯人，来攻击约兰。 Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 他们上来攻击犹大，侵入境内，掳掠了王宫里所有的财货和他的妻子、儿女，除了他小儿子约哈斯(又名“亚哈谢”)之外，没有留下一个儿子。 And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 这些事以后，耶和华使约兰的肠子患不能医治的病。 And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他患此病缠绵日久，过了二年，肠子坠落下来，病重而死。他的民没有为他烧什么物件，像从前为他列祖所烧的一样。 And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 约兰登基的时候年三十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王八年。他去世无人思慕，众人葬他在大卫城，只是不在列王的坟墓里。 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired.

So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 亚哈谢登基的时候年四十二岁(列王下八章二十六节作二十二岁)，在耶路撒冷作王一年。他母亲名叫亚他利雅，是暗利的孙女。 Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 亚哈谢也行亚哈家的道。因为他母亲给他主谋，使他行恶。 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，象亚哈家一样；因他父亲死后有亚哈家的人给他主谋，以致败坏。 Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他听从亚哈家的计谋，同以色列王亚哈的儿子约兰往基列的拉末去，与亚兰王哈薛争战，亚兰人打伤了约兰。 He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 约兰回到耶斯列，医治在拉末与亚兰王哈薛打仗所受的伤，犹大王约兰的儿子亚撒利雅(即“亚哈谢”)因为亚哈的儿子约兰病了，就下到耶斯列看望他。 And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 亚哈谢去见约兰就被害了，这是出乎　神，因为他到了，就同约兰出去攻击宁示的孙子耶户；这耶户是耶和华所膏，使他剪除亚哈家的。 And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 耶户讨亚哈家罪的时候，遇见犹大的众首领和亚哈谢的众侄子服事亚哈谢，就把他们都杀了。 And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 亚哈谢藏在撒玛利亚，耶户寻找他；众人将他拿住，送到耶户那里，就杀了他，将他葬埋。因他们说，他是那尽心寻求耶和华之约沙法的儿子。这样，亚哈谢的家无力保守国权。 And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 亚哈谢的母亲亚他利雅见她儿子死了，就起来剿灭犹大王室。 But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 但王的女儿约示巴，将亚哈谢的儿子约阿施，从那被杀的王子中偷出来，把他和他的乳母都藏在卧房里。约示巴是约兰王的女儿，亚哈谢的妹子，祭司耶何耶大的妻。她收藏约阿施，躲避亚他利雅，免得被杀。 But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 约阿施和她们一同藏在　神殿里六年，亚他利雅篡了国位。 And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_23">历代志下 23</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 第七年，耶何耶大奋勇自强，将百夫长耶罗罕的儿子亚撒利雅、约哈难的儿子以实玛利、俄备得的儿子亚撒利雅、亚大雅的儿子玛西雅、细基利的儿子以利沙法召来，与他们立约。 And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 他们走遍犹大，从犹大各城里招聚利未人和以色列的众族长，到耶路撒冷来。 And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 会众在　神殿里与王立约。耶何耶大对他们说：“看哪！王的儿子必当作王，正如耶和华指着大卫子孙所应许的话。” And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God.

And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 亚他利雅听见民奔走，赞美王的声音，就到民那里，进耶和华的殿。 Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 看见王站在殿门的柱旁，百夫长和吹号的人侍立在王左右，国民都欢乐吹号；又有歌唱的，用各样的乐器领人歌唱赞美，亚他利雅就撕裂衣服，喊叫说：“反了！反了！” And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 祭司耶何耶大带管辖军兵的百夫长出来，吩咐他们说：“将她赶到班外，凡跟随她的必用刀杀死。”因为祭司说：“不可在耶和华殿里杀她。” Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 众兵就闪开，让她去。她走到王宫的马门，便在那里把她杀了。 So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 耶何耶大与众民和王立约，都要作耶和华的民。 And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD's people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 于是众民都到巴力庙，拆毁了庙，打碎坛和像，又在坛前将巴力的祭司玛坦杀了。 Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 耶何耶大派官看守耶和华的殿，是在祭司利未人手下。这祭司利未人是大卫分派在耶和华殿中，照摩西律法上所写的，给耶和华献燔祭，又按大卫所定的例，欢乐歌唱。 Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 且设立守门的把守耶和华殿的各门，无论为何事，不洁净的人都不准进去。 And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 又率领百夫长和贵胄，与民间的官长，并国中的众民，请王从耶和华殿下来，由上门进入王宫，立王坐在国位上。 And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 国民都欢乐，合城都安静。众人已将亚他利雅用刀杀了。 And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_24">历代志下 24</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 约阿施登基的时候年七岁，在耶路撒冷作王四十年。他母亲名叫西比亚，是别是巴人。 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem.

Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 王召了大祭司耶何耶大来，对他说：“从前耶和华的仆人摩西，为法柜的帐幕，与以色列会众所定的捐项，你为何不叫利未人，照这例从犹大和耶路撒冷带来，作殿的费用呢？” And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 因为那恶妇亚他利雅的众子曾拆毁　神的殿，又用耶和华殿中分别为圣的物供奉巴力。 For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 于是王下令，众人作了一柜，放在耶和华殿的门外， And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 又通告犹大和耶路撒冷的百姓，要将　神仆人摩西，在旷野所吩咐以色列人的捐项给耶和华送来。 And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 众首领和百姓都欢欢喜喜地将银子送来，投入柜中，直到捐完。 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 利未人见银子多了，就把柜抬到王所派的司事面前，王的书记和大祭司的属员来，将柜倒空，仍放在原处。日日都是这样，积蓄的银子甚多。 Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 王与耶何耶大将银子交给耶和华殿里办事的人，他们就雇了石匠、木匠，重修耶和华的殿；又雇了铁匠、铜匠，修理耶和华的殿。 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 工人操作，渐渐修成，将　神殿修造得与从前一样，而且甚是坚固。 So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 工程完了，他们就把其余的银子拿到王与耶何耶大面前，用以制造耶和华殿供奉所用的器皿和调羹，并金银的器皿。耶何耶大在世的时候，众人常在耶和华殿里献燔祭。 And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver.

And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 满了一年，亚兰的军兵上来攻击约阿施，来到犹大和耶路撒冷，杀了民中的众首领，将所掠的财货送到大马色王那里。 And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 亚兰的军兵，虽来了一小队，耶和华却将大队的军兵交在他们手里，是因犹大人离弃耶和华他们列祖的　神，所以藉亚兰人惩罚约阿施。 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 亚兰人离开约阿施的时候，他患重病，臣仆背叛他，要报祭司耶何耶大儿子流血之仇，杀他在床上，葬他在大卫城，只是不葬在列王的坟墓里。 And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 背叛他的是亚扪妇人示米押的儿子撒拔和摩押妇人示米利的儿子约萨拔。 And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 至于他的众子和他所受的警戒，并他重修　神殿的事，都写在列王的传上。他儿子亚玛谢接续他作王。 Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings.

And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 于是，亚玛谢将那从以法莲来的军兵分别出来，叫他们回家去。故此，他们甚恼怒犹大人，气忿忿地回家去了。 Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 亚玛谢壮起胆来，率领他的民到盐谷，杀了西珥人一万。 And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 犹大人又生擒了一万带到山崖上，从那里把他们扔下去，以致他们都摔碎了。 And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 但亚玛谢所打发回去，不许一同出征的那些军兵，攻打犹大各城，从撒玛利亚直到伯和仑，杀了三千人，抢了许多财物。 But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 亚玛谢杀了以东人回来，就把西珥的神像带回，立为自己的神，在它面前叩拜烧香。 Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 因此，耶和华的怒气向亚玛谢发作，就差一个先知去见他，说：“这些神不能救它的民脱离你的手，你为何寻求它呢？” Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 先知与王说话的时候，王对他说：“谁立你作王的谋士呢？你住口吧！为何找打呢？”先知就止住了，又说：“你行这事不听从我的劝戒，我知道　神定意要灭你。” And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 犹大王亚玛谢与群臣商议，就差遣使者去见耶户的孙子约哈斯的儿子以色列王约阿施，说：“你来！我们二人相见于战场。” Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 以色列王约阿施差遣使者去见犹大王亚玛谢说：“黎巴嫩的蒺藜，差遣使者去见黎巴嫩的香柏树，说：‘将你的女儿给我儿子为妻。’后来黎巴嫩有一个野兽经过，把蒺藜践踏了。 And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 你说：‘看哪！我打败了以东人。’你就心高气傲，以致矜夸。你在家里安居就罢了，为何要惹祸使自己和犹大国一同败亡呢？” Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 亚玛谢却不肯听从，这是出乎　神，好将他们交在敌人手里，因为他们寻求以东的神。 But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 于是以色列王约阿施上来，在犹大的伯示麦与犹大王亚玛谢相见于战场。 So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 犹大人败在以色列人面前，各自逃回家里去了。 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 以色列王约阿施，在伯示麦擒住约哈斯(就是亚哈谢)的孙子约阿施的儿子犹大王亚玛谢，将他带到耶路撒冷。又拆毁耶路撒冷的城墙，从以法莲门直到角门，共四百肘。 And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 又将俄别以东所看守　神殿里的一切金银和器皿，与王宫里的财宝，都拿了去；并带人去为质，就回撒玛利亚去了。 And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 以色列王约哈斯的儿子约阿施死后，犹大王约阿施的儿子亚玛谢又活了十五年。 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 亚玛谢其余的事，自始至终，不都写在犹大和以色列诸王记上吗？ Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 自从亚玛谢离弃耶和华之后，在耶路撒冷有人背叛他，他就逃到拉吉，叛党却打发人到拉吉，将他杀了。 Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 人就用马将他的尸首驮回，葬在犹大京城他列祖的坟地里。 And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_26">历代志下 26</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 犹大众民立亚玛谢的儿子乌西雅(又名亚撒利雅)接续他父作王，那时他年十六岁。 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 亚玛谢与他列祖同睡之后，乌西雅收回以禄仍归犹大，又重新修理。 He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 乌西雅登基的时候，年十六岁，在耶路撒冷作王五十二年。他母亲名叫耶可利雅，是耶路撒冷人。 Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem.

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 因为以色列王亚哈斯在犹大放肆，大大干犯耶和华，所以耶和华使犹大卑微。 For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 这亚哈斯王在急难的时候，越发得罪耶和华。 And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 他祭祀攻击他的大马色之神，说：“因为亚兰王的神帮助他们，我也献祭与他，他好帮助我。”但那些神使他和以色列众人败亡了。 For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 亚哈斯将　神殿里的器皿都聚了来，毁坏了，且封锁耶和华殿的门。在耶路撒冷各处的拐角建筑祭坛； And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 又在犹大各城建立邱坛，与别神烧香，惹动耶和华他列祖　神的怒气。 And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 亚哈斯其余的事和他的行为，自始至终都写在犹大和以色列诸王记上。 Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 亚哈斯与他列祖同睡，葬在耶路撒冷城里，没有送入以色列诸王的坟墓中。他儿子希西家接续他作王。 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_29">历代志下 29</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 希西家登基的时候，年二十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王二十九年。他母亲名叫亚比雅，是撒迦利雅的女儿。 Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem.

And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 就宰了公牛，祭司接血洒在坛上；宰了公羊，把血洒在坛上；又宰了羊羔，也把血洒在坛上； So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 把那作赎罪祭的公山羊，牵到王和会众面前，他们就按手在其上。 And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 祭司宰了羊，将血献在坛上作赎罪祭，为以色列众人赎罪，因为王吩咐将燔祭和赎罪祭，为以色列众人献上。 And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 王又派利未人在耶和华殿中敲钹、鼓瑟、弹琴，乃照大卫和他先见迦得，并先知拿单所吩咐的，就是耶和华藉先知所吩咐的。 And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 利未人拿大卫的乐器，祭司拿号，一同站立。 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 希西家吩咐在坛上献燔祭，燔祭一献，就唱赞美耶和华的歌，用号，并用以色列王大卫的乐器相和。 And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 会众都敬拜，歌唱的歌唱，吹号的吹号，如此直到燔祭献完了。 And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 献完了祭，王和一切跟随的人都俯伏敬拜。 And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 希西家王与众首领，又吩咐利未人用大卫和先见亚萨的诗词，颂赞耶和华；他们就欢欢喜喜地颂赞耶和华，低头敬拜。 Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 希西家说：“你们既然归耶和华为圣，就要前来把祭物和感谢祭奉到耶和华殿里。”会众就把祭物和感谢祭奉来，凡甘心乐意的也将燔祭奉来。 Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 会众所奉的燔祭如下：公牛七十只、公羊一百只、羊羔二百只，这都是作燔祭献给耶和华的。 And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 又有分别为圣之物、公牛六百只、绵羊三千只。 And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 但祭司太少，不能剥尽燔祭牲的皮，所以他们的弟兄利未人帮助他们，直等燔祭的事完了，又等别的祭司自洁了，因为利未人诚心自洁，胜过祭司。 But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 燔祭和平安祭牲的脂油，并燔祭同献的奠祭甚多。这样，耶和华殿中的事务俱都齐备了(或作“就整顿了”)。 And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 这事办得甚速，希西家和众民都喜乐，是因　神为众民所预备的。 And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_30">历代志下 30</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 因为王和众首领，并耶路撒冷全会众已经商议，要在二月内守逾越节。 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 正月(原文作“那时”)间他们不能守，因为自洁的祭司尚不敷用，百姓也没有聚集在耶路撒冷。 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 王与全会众都以这事为善。 And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 于是定了命令，传遍以色列，从别是巴直到但，使他们都来，在耶路撒冷向耶和华以色列的　神守逾越节，因为照所写的例，守这节的不多了(或作“因为民许久没有照所写的例守节了”)。 So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 驿卒就把王和众首领的信，遵着王命，传遍以色列和犹大。信内说：“以色列人哪！你们当转向耶和华亚伯拉罕、以撒、以色列的　神，好叫他转向你们这脱离亚述王手的余民。 So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 你们不要效法你们列祖和你们的弟兄，他们干犯耶和华他们列祖的　神，以致耶和华丢弃他们，使他们败亡(或作“令人惊骇”)，正如你们所见的。 And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 现在不要象你们列祖硬着颈项，只要归顺耶和华，进入他的圣所，就是永远成圣的居所。又要事奉耶和华你们的　神，好使他的烈怒转离你们。 Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 你们若转向耶和华，你们的弟兄和儿女，必在掳掠他们的人面前蒙怜恤，得以归回这地，因为耶和华你们的　神有恩典、施怜悯。你们若转向他，他必不转脸不顾你们。” For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 驿卒就由这城跑到那城，传遍了以法莲、玛拿西，直到西布伦。那里的人却戏笑他们，讥诮他们。 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 然而亚设、玛拿西、西布伦中，也有人自卑，来到耶路撒冷。 Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 　神也感动犹大人，使他们一心遵行王与众首领凭耶和华之言所发的命令。 Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 二月，有许多人在耶路撒冷聚集，成为大会，要守除酵节。 And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他们起来，把耶路撒冷的祭坛和烧香的坛，尽都除去，抛在汲沦溪中。 And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 二月十四日，宰了逾越节的羊羔。祭司与利未人觉得惭愧，就洁净自己，把燔祭奉到耶和华殿中， Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 遵着神人摩西的律法，照例站在自己的地方。祭司从利未人手里接过血来，洒在坛上。 And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 会中有许多人尚未自洁，所以利未人为一切不洁之人宰逾越节的羊羔，使他们在耶和华面前成为圣洁。 For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 以法莲、玛拿西、以萨迦、西布伦，有许多人尚未自洁，他们却也吃逾越节的羊羔，不合所记录的定例。希西家为他们祷告说：“凡专心寻求　神，就是耶和华他列祖之　神的，虽不照着圣所洁净之礼自洁，求至善的耶和华也饶恕他。” That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 耶和华垂听希西家的祷告，就饶恕(原文作“医治”)百姓。 And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 在耶路撒冷的以色列人，大大喜乐，守除酵节七日。利未人和祭司，用响亮的乐器，日日颂赞耶和华。 And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 希西家慰劳一切善于事奉耶和华的利未人。于是众人吃节筵七日，又献平安祭，且向耶和华他们列祖的　神认罪。 And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 全会众商议，要再守节七日；于是欢欢喜喜地又守节七日。 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 犹大王希西家赐给会众公牛一千只、羊七千只为祭物；众首领也赐给会众公牛一千只，羊一万只，并有许多的祭司洁净自己。 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 犹大全会众，祭司利未人，并那从以色列地来的会众，和寄居的人，以及犹大寄居的人，尽都喜乐。 And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 这样，在耶路撒冷大有喜乐，自从以色列王大卫儿子所罗门的时候，在耶路撒冷没有这样的喜乐。 So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 那时，祭司利未人起来，为民祝福。他们的声音，蒙　神垂听；他们的祷告，达到天上的圣所。 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_31">历代志下 31</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 这事既都完毕，在那里的以色列众人，就到犹大的城邑，打碎柱像，砍断木偶；又在犹大、便雅悯、以法莲、玛拿西遍地，将邱坛和祭坛拆毁净尽。于是以色列众人各回各城，各归各地。 Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 希西家派定祭司利未人的班次，各按各职献燔祭和平安祭；又在耶和华殿(原文作“营”)门内事奉、称谢、颂赞耶和华。 And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 王又从自己的产业中，定出分来为燔祭，就是早晚的燔祭，和安息日、月朔，并节期的燔祭，都是按耶和华律法上所载的。 He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 又吩咐住耶路撒冷的百姓，将祭司利未人所应得的分给他们，使他们专心遵守耶和华的律法。 Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 谕旨一出，以色列人就把初熟的五谷、新酒、油、蜜，和田地的出产，多多送来；又把各物的十分之一，送来的极多。 And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 住犹大各城的以色列人和犹大人，也将牛羊的十分之一，并分别为圣归耶和华他们　神之物，就是十分取一之物，尽都送来，积成堆垒。 And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 从三月积起，到七月才完。 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 希西家和众首领来，看见堆垒，就称颂耶和华；又为耶和华的民以色列人祝福。 And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 希西家向祭司利未人查问这堆垒。 Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 撒督家的大祭司亚撒利雅回答说：“自从民将供物送到耶和华殿以来，我们不但吃饱，且剩下的甚多，因为耶和华赐福与他的民，所剩下的才这样丰盛。” And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 希西家吩咐在耶和华殿里预备仓房，他们就预备了。 Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他们诚心将供物和十分取一之物，并分别为圣之物，都搬入仓内。利未人歌楠雅掌管这事，他兄弟示每为副管。 And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 按名派定的人，要把应得的，分给亚伦子孙，住在各城郊野祭司所有的男丁和一切载入家谱的利未人。 Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 希西家在犹大遍地这样办理，行耶和华他　神眼中看为善为正为忠的事。 And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 凡他所行的，无论是办　神殿的事，是遵律法守诫命，是寻求他的　神，都是尽心去行，无不亨通。 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_32">历代志下 32</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 这虔诚的事以后，亚述王西拿基立来侵入犹大，围困一切坚固城，想要攻破占据。 After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 希西家见西拿基立来，定意要攻打耶路撒冷， And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 就与首领和勇士商议，塞住城外的泉源，他们就都帮助他。 He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 于是有许多人聚集，塞了一切泉源，并通流国中的小河。说：“亚述王来，为何让他得着许多水呢？” So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 希西家力图自强，就修筑所有拆毁的城墙，高与城楼相齐；在城外又筑一城，坚固大卫城的米罗，制造了许多军器、盾牌。 Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 设立军长管理百姓，将他们招聚在城门的宽阔处，用话勉励他们，说： And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: “你们当刚强壮胆，不要因亚述王和跟随他的大军恐惧、惊慌，因为与我们同在的，比与他们同在的更大； Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 此后，亚述王西拿基立和他的全军攻打拉吉，就差遣臣仆到耶路撒冷见犹大王希西家和一切在耶路撒冷的犹大人，说： After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: “亚述王西拿基立如此说：你们倚靠什么，还在耶路撒冷受困呢？ Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 希西家对你们说，耶和华我们的　神必救我们脱离亚述王的手，这不是诱惑你们，使你们受饥渴而死吗？ Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 这希西家岂不是废去耶和华的邱坛和祭坛，吩咐犹大与耶路撒冷的人说，你们当在一个坛前敬拜，在其上烧香吗？ Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我与我列祖向列邦所行的，你们岂不知道吗？列邦的神，何尝能救自己的国脱离我手呢？ Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 我列祖所灭的国，那些神中谁能救自己的民脱离我手呢？难道你们的神能救你们脱离我手吗？ Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 所以你们不要叫希西家这样欺哄诱惑你们，也不要信他，因为没有一国一邦的神，能救自己的民脱离我手和我列祖的手，何况你们的神，更不能救你们脱离我的手。” Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 西拿基立的臣仆，还有别的话毁谤耶和华　神和他仆人希西家。 And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 西拿基立也写信毁谤耶和华以色列的　神，说：“列邦的神既不能救他的民脱离我手，希西家的神也不能救他的民脱离我手了。” He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 亚述王的臣仆用犹大言语，向耶路撒冷城上的民大声呼叫，要惊吓他们，扰乱他们，以便取城。 Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他们论耶路撒冷的　神，如同论世上人手所造的神一样。 And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 希西家王和亚摩斯的儿子先知以赛亚，因此祷告，向天呼求。 And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 耶和华就差遣一个使者，进入亚述王营中，把所有大能的勇士和官长、将帅，尽都灭了。亚述王满面含羞地回到本国，进了他神的庙中，有他亲生的儿子在那里用刀杀了他。 And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 这样，耶和华救希西家和耶路撒冷的居民，脱离亚述王西拿基立的手，也脱离一切仇敌的手，又赐他们四境平安。 Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 有许多人到耶路撒冷，将供物献与耶和华，又将宝物送给犹大王希西家。此后，希西家在列邦人的眼中看为尊大。 And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 那时希西家病得要死，就祷告耶和华，耶和华应允他，赐他一个兆头。 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 希西家却没有照他所蒙的恩，报答耶和华，因他心里骄傲，所以忿怒要临到他和犹大并耶路撒冷。 But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 但希西家和耶路撒冷的居民，觉得心里骄傲，就一同自卑，以致耶和华的忿怒在希西家的日子，没有临到他们。 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 希西家大有尊荣资财，建造府库，收藏金银、宝石、香料、盾牌和各样的宝器。 And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 又建造仓房、收藏五谷、新酒和油。又为各类牲畜，盖棚立圈。 Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 并且建立城邑，还有许多的羊群牛群，因为　神赐他极多的财产。 Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 这希西家也塞住基训的上源，引水直下，流在大卫城的西边。希西家所行的事，尽都亨通。 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 惟有一件事，就是巴比伦王差遣使者来见希西家，访问国中所现的奇事；这件事　神离开他，要试验他，好知道他心内如何。 Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 希西家其余的事和他的善行，都写在亚摩斯的儿子先知以赛亚的默示书上，和犹大、以色列的诸王记上。 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 希西家与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫子孙的高陵上。他死的时候，犹大人和耶路撒冷的居民都尊敬他。他儿子玛拿西接续他作王。 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_33">历代志下 33</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 玛拿西登基的时候，年十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王五十五年。 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，效法耶和华在以色列人面前赶出的外邦人那可憎的事。 But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 重新建筑他父希西家所拆毁的邱坛，又为巴力筑坛，作木偶，且敬拜事奉天上的万象， For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 在耶和华的殿宇中筑坛。耶和华曾指着这殿说：“我的名必永远在耶路撒冷。” Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他在耶和华殿的两院中，为天上的万象筑坛。 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 并在欣嫩子谷，使他的儿女经火。又观兆、用法术、行邪术、立交鬼的，和行巫术的，多行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，惹动他的怒气。 And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 又在　神殿内立雕刻的偶像。　神曾对大卫和他儿子所罗门说：“我在以色列各支派中，所选择的耶路撒冷和这殿，必立我的名直到永远。 And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 以色列人若谨守遵行我藉摩西所吩咐他们的一切法度、律例、典章，我就不再使他们挪移离开我所赐给他们列祖之地。” Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 玛拿西引诱犹大和耶路撒冷的居民，以致他们行恶比耶和华在以色列人面前所灭的列国更甚。 So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 耶和华警戒玛拿西和他的百姓，他们却是不听。 And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 所以耶和华使亚述王的将帅来攻击他们，用铙钩钩住玛拿西，用铜链锁住他，带到巴比伦去。 Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他在急难的时候，就恳求耶和华他的　神，且在他列祖的　神面前极其自卑。 And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他祈祷耶和华，耶和华就允准他的祈求，垂听他的祷告，使他归回耶路撒冷，仍坐国位。玛拿西这才知道惟独耶和华是　神。 And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 此后，玛拿西在大卫城外，从谷内基训西边，直到鱼门口，建筑城墙，环绕俄斐勒，这墙筑得甚高。又在犹大各坚固城内，设立勇敢的军长。 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 并除掉外邦人的神像与耶和华殿中的偶像；又将他在耶和华殿的山上和耶路撒冷所筑的各坛，都拆毁抛在城外。 And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 重修耶和华的祭坛，在坛上献平安祭、感谢祭，吩咐犹大人事奉耶和华以色列的　神。 And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 百姓却仍在邱坛上献祭，只献给耶和华他们的　神。 Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 玛拿西其余的事，和祷告他　神的话，并先见奉耶和华以色列　神的名警戒他的言语，都写在以色列诸王记上。 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他的祷告，与　神怎样应允他，他未自卑以前的罪愆过犯，并在何处建筑邱坛，设立亚舍拉和雕刻的偶像，都写在何赛的书上。 His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 玛拿西与他列祖同睡，葬在自己的宫院里。他儿子亚们接续他作王。 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 亚们登基的时候，年二十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王二年。 Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，效法他父玛拿西所行的，祭祀事奉他父玛拿西所雕刻的偶像。 But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 不在耶和华面前象他父玛拿西自卑，这亚们所犯的罪，越犯越大。 And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 他的臣仆背叛，在宫里杀了他。 And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 但国民杀了那些背叛亚们王的人，立他儿子约西亚接续他作王。 But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 他行耶和华眼中看为正的事，效法他祖大卫所行的，不偏左右。 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 他作王第八年，尚且年幼，就寻求他祖大卫的　神。到了十二年才洁净犹大和耶路撒冷，除掉邱坛、木偶、雕刻的像，和铸造的像。 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 众人在他面前拆毁巴力的坛，砍断坛上高高的日像，又把木偶和雕刻的像，并铸造的像打碎成灰，撒在祭偶像人的坟上， And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 将他们祭司的骸骨烧在坛上，洁净了犹大和耶路撒冷。 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 又在玛拿西、以法莲、西缅、拿弗他利各城，和四围破坏之处，都这样行。 And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 又拆毁祭坛，把木偶和雕刻的像打碎成灰，砍断以色列遍地所有的日像，就回耶路撒冷去了。 And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 约西亚王十八年，净地净殿之后，就差遣亚萨利雅的儿子沙番、邑宰玛西雅、约哈斯的儿子史官约亚、去修理耶和华他　神的殿。 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他们就去见大祭司希勒家，将奉到　神殿的银子交给他。这银子是看守殿门的利未人从玛拿西、以法莲，和一切以色列剩下的人，以及犹大、便雅悯众人，并耶路撒冷的居民收来的。 And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 又将这银子交给耶和华殿里督工的，转交修理耶和华殿的工匠， And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 就是交给木匠、石匠，买凿成的石头和架木，与栋梁，修犹大王所毁坏的殿。 Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 这些人办事诚实，督工的是利未人米拉利的子孙雅哈、俄巴底；督催的是哥辖的子孙撒迦利亚、米书兰，还有善于作乐的利未人。 And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他们又监管扛抬的人，督催一切作工的。利未人中，也有作书记、作司事、作守门的。 Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他们将奉到耶和华殿的银子运出来的时候，祭司希勒家偶然得了摩西所传耶和华的律法书。 And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 希勒家对书记沙番说：“我在耶和华殿里得了律法书。”遂将书递给沙番。 And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 沙番把书拿到王那里，回复王说：“凡交给仆人们办的都办理了。 And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 耶和华殿里的银子倒出来，交给督工的和匠人的手里了。” And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 书记沙番又对王说：“祭司希勒家递给我一卷书。”沙番就在王面前读那书。 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 王听见律法上的话，就撕裂衣服， And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 吩咐希勒家与沙番的儿子亚希甘，米迦的儿子亚比顿，书记沙番和王的臣仆亚撒雅，说： And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: “你们去为我为以色列和犹大剩下的人，以这书上的话求问耶和华，因我们列祖没有遵守耶和华的言语，没有照这书上所记的去行，耶和华的烈怒就倒在我们身上。” Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 于是希勒家和王所派的众人，都去见女先知户勒大。户勒大是掌管礼服沙龙的妻，沙龙是哈斯拉的孙子特瓦的儿子。户勒大住在耶路撒冷第二区。他们请问于她。 And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that effect.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 她对他们说：“耶和华以色列的　神如此说：‘你们可以回复那差遣你们来见我的人说， And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 耶和华如此说：我必照着在犹大王面前所读那书上的一切咒诅，降祸与这地和其上的居民； Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 因为他们离弃我，向别神烧香，用他们手所作的惹我发怒，所以我的忿怒如火倒在这地上，总不熄灭。’ Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 然而差遣你们来求问耶和华的犹大王，你们要这样回复他说：‘耶和华以色列的　神如此说：至于你所听见的话， And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 就是听见我指着这地和其上居民所说的话，你便心里敬服，在我面前自卑，撕裂衣服，向我哭泣。因此，我应允了你，这是我耶和华说的。 Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 我必使你平平安安地归到坟墓，到你列祖那里，我要降与这地和其上居民的一切灾祸，你也不至亲眼看见。’”他们就回复王去了。 Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 王差遣人招聚犹大和耶路撒冷的众长老来。 Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 王和犹大众人与耶路撒冷的居民，并祭司利未人，以及所有的百姓，无论大小，都一同上到耶和华的殿。王就把殿里所得的约书，念给他们听。 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 王站在他的地位上，在耶和华面前立约，要尽心尽性地顺从耶和华，遵守他的诫命、法度、律例，成就这书上所记的约言。 And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 又使住耶路撒冷和便雅悯的人都服从这约。于是耶路撒冷的居民，都遵行他们列祖之　神的约。 And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 约西亚从以色列各处，将一切可憎之物尽都除掉，使以色列境内的人都事奉耶和华他们的　神。约西亚在世的日子，就跟从耶和华他们列祖的　神，总不离开。 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_35">历代志下 35</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 约西亚在耶路撒冷向耶和华守逾越节。正月十四日，就宰了逾越节的羊羔。 Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 王分派祭司各尽其职，又勉励他们办耶和华殿中的事。 And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 又对那归耶和华为圣，教训以色列人的利未人说：“你们将圣约柜安放在以色列王大卫儿子所罗门建造的殿里，不必再用肩扛抬。现在要事奉耶和华你们的　神，服事他的民以色列。 And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 你们应当按着宗族，照着班次，遵以色列王大卫和他儿子所罗门所写的，自己预备。 And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 要按着你们的弟兄，这民宗族的班次，站在圣所，每班中要利未宗族的几个人。 And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 要宰逾越节的羊羔，洁净自己。为你们的弟兄预备了，好遵守耶和华藉摩西所吩咐的话。” So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 约西亚从群畜中赐给在那里所有的人民，绵羊羔和山羊羔三万只、牛三千只，作逾越节的祭物。这都是出自王的产业中。 And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 约西亚的众首领也乐意将牺牲给百姓和祭司利未人。又有管理　神殿的希勒家、撒迦利亚、耶歇，将羊羔二千六百只、牛三百只，给祭司作逾越节的祭物。 And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 利未人的族长歌楠雅和他两个兄弟示玛雅、拿坦业，与哈沙比雅、耶利、约撒拔，将羊羔五千只、牛五百只，给利未人作逾越节的祭物。 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 这样，供献的事齐备了。祭司站在自己的地方，利未人按着班次站立，都是照王所吩咐的。 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 利未人宰了逾越节的羊羔，祭司从他们手里接过血来洒在坛上，利未人剥皮， And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 将燔祭搬来，按着宗族的班次分给众民，好照摩西书上所写的，献给耶和华；献牛也是这样。 And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他们按着常例，用火烤逾越节的羊羔。别的圣物用锅、用釜、用罐煮了，速速地送给众民。 And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 然后为自己和祭司预备祭物，因为祭司亚伦的子孙献燔祭和脂油，直到晚上；所以利未人为自己和祭司亚伦的子孙，预备祭物。 And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 歌唱的亚萨之子孙，照着大卫、亚萨、希幔，和王的先见耶杜顿所吩咐的，站在自己的地位上。守门的看守各门，不用离开他们的职事，因为他们的弟兄利未人给他们预备祭物。 And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 当日，供奉耶和华的事齐备了，就照约西亚王的吩咐守逾越节，献燔祭在耶和华的坛上。 So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 当时在耶路撒冷的以色列人守逾越节，又守除酵节七日。 And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 自从先知撒母耳以来，在以色列中没有守过这样的逾越节，以色列诸王也没有守过，象约西亚、祭司、利未人在那里的犹大人和以色列人，以及耶路撒冷居民所守的逾越节。 And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 这逾越节是约西亚作王十八年守的。 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 这事以后，约西亚修完了殿，有埃及王尼哥上来，要攻击靠近伯拉河的迦基米施；约西亚出去抵挡他。 After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 他差遣使者来见约西亚说：“犹大王啊！我与你何干？我今日来不是要攻击你，乃是要攻击与我争战之家。并且　神吩咐我速行，你不要干预　神的事，免得他毁灭你，因为　神是与我同在。” But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 约西亚却不肯转去离开他，改装要与他打仗，不听从　神藉尼哥之口所说的话，便来到米吉多平原争战。 Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 弓箭手射中约西亚王。王对他的臣仆说：“我受了重伤，你拉我出阵吧！” And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 他的臣仆扶他下了战车，上了次车，送他到耶路撒冷，他就死了，葬在他列祖的坟墓里。犹大人和耶路撒冷人，都为他悲哀。 His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 耶利米为约西亚作哀歌，所有歌唱的男女也唱哀歌，追悼约西亚，直到今日；而且在以色列中成了定例。这歌载在哀歌书上。 And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 约西亚其余的事，和他遵着耶和华律法上所记而行的善事， Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 并他自始至终所行的，都写在以色列和犹大列王记上。 And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor14_36">历代志下 36</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 国民立约西亚的儿子约哈斯，在耶路撒冷接续他父作王。 Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 约哈斯登基的时候年二十三岁，在耶路撒冷作王三个月。 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 埃及王在耶路撒冷废了他，又罚犹大国银子一百他连得，金子一他连得。 And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 埃及王尼哥立约哈斯的哥哥以利雅敬作犹大和耶路撒冷的王，改名叫约雅敬，又将约哈斯带到埃及去了。 And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 约雅敬登基的时候年二十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王十一年。行耶和华他　神眼中看为恶的事。 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒上来攻击他，用铜链锁着他，要将他带到巴比伦去。 Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 尼布甲尼撒又将耶和华殿里的器皿带到巴比伦，放在他神的庙里(或作“自己的宫里”)。 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 约雅敬其余的事和他所行可憎的事，并他一切的行为，都写在以色列和犹大列王记上。他儿子约雅斤接续他作王。 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 约雅斤登基的时候年八岁(列王下二十四章八节作十八岁)，在耶路撒冷作王三个月零十天。行耶和华眼中看为恶的事。 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 过了一年，尼布甲尼撒差遣人，将约雅斤和耶和华殿里各样宝贵的器皿带到巴比伦，就立约雅斤的叔叔(原文作“兄”)西底家，作犹大和耶路撒冷的王。 And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 众祭司长和百姓也大大犯罪，效法外邦人一切可憎的事，污秽耶和华在耶路撒冷分别为圣的殿。 Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 耶和华他们列祖的　神因为爱惜自己的民和他的居所，从早起来差遣使者去警戒他们。 And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 这就应验耶和华藉耶利米口所说的话：地享受安息；因为地土荒凉便守安息，直满了七十年。 To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 波斯王古列元年，耶和华为要应验藉耶利米口所说的话，就激动波斯王古列的心，使他下诏通告全国，说： Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: “波斯王古列如此说：‘耶和华天上的　神已将天下万国赐给我，又嘱咐我在犹大的耶路撒冷为他建造殿宇。你们中间凡作他子民的，可以上去，愿耶和华他的　神与他同在。’” Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people? The LORD his God be with him, and let him go up.</p>
