And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 以利加拿每逢献祭的日子，将祭肉分给他的妻毗尼拿和毗尼拿所生的儿女； And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 给哈拿的却是双份，因为他爱哈拿。无奈耶和华不使哈拿生育！ But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 毗尼拿见耶和华不使哈拿生育，就作她的对头，大大激动她，要使她生气。 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 每年上到耶和华殿的时候，以利加拿都以双份给哈拿；毗尼拿仍是激动她，以致她哭泣不吃饭。 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 她丈夫以利加拿对她说：“哈拿啊！你为何哭泣，不吃饭，心里愁闷呢？有我不比十个儿子还好吗？” Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他们在示罗吃喝完了，哈拿就站起来。祭司以利在耶和华殿的门框旁边，坐在自己的位上。 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 哈拿心里愁苦，就痛痛哭泣，祈祷耶和华， And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 许愿说：“万军之耶和华啊！你若垂顾婢女的苦情，眷念不忘婢女，赐我一个儿子，我必使他终身归与耶和华，不用剃头刀剃他的头。” And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 哈拿在耶和华面前不住地祈祷，以利定睛看她的嘴。 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 原来哈拿心中默祷，只动嘴唇，不出声音，因此以利以为她喝醉了。 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 以利对她说：“你要醉到几时呢？你不应该喝酒！” And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 哈拿回答说：“主啊！不是这样，我是心里愁苦的妇人，清酒浓酒都没有喝，但在耶和华面前倾心吐意。 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 不要将婢女看作不正经的女子；我因被人激动，愁苦太多，所以祈求到如今。” Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 以利说：“你可以平平安安地回去，愿以色列的　神，允准你向他所求的。” Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 哈拿说：“愿婢女在你眼前蒙恩。”于是妇人走去吃饭，面上再不带愁容了。 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 次日清早，他们起来，在耶和华面前敬拜，就回拉玛。到了家里，以利加拿和妻哈拿同房，耶和华顾念哈拿， And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 哈拿就怀孕。日期满足，生了一个儿子，给他起名叫撒母耳，说：“这是我从耶和华那里求来的。” Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 以利加拿和他全家都上示罗去，要向耶和华献年祭，并还所许的愿。 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 哈拿却没有上去，对丈夫说：“等孩子断了奶，我便带他上去朝见耶和华，使他永远住在那里。” But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 她丈夫以利加拿说：“就随你的意行吧！可以等儿子断了奶，但愿耶和华应验他的话。”于是妇人在家里乳养儿子，直到断了奶。 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 既断了奶，就把孩子带上示罗，到了耶和华的殿；又带了三只公牛，一伊法细面，一皮袋酒。那时孩子还小。 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 宰了一只公牛，就领孩子到以利面前。 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 妇人说：“主啊！我敢在你面前起誓，从前在你这里，站着祈求耶和华的那妇人，就是我。 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 我祈求为要得这孩子，耶和华已将我所求的赐给我了。 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 所以我将这孩子归与耶和华，使他终身归与耶和华。”于是在那里敬拜耶和华。 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_2">撒母耳记上 2</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 哈拿祷告说：“我的心因耶和华快乐，我的角因耶和华高举，我的口向仇敌张开，我因耶和华的救恩欢欣！ And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 只有耶和华为圣，除他以外没有可比的，也没有磐石象我们的　神。 There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 人不要夸口说骄傲的话，也不要出狂妄的言语；因耶和华是大有智识的　神，人的行为被他衡量。 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 勇士的弓都已折断。跌倒的人以力量束腰； The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 素来饱足的，反作佣人求食；饥饿的，再不饥饿；不生育的，生了七个儿子；多有儿女的，反倒衰微。 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 耶和华使人死，也使人活；使人下阴间，也使人往上升。 The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 他使人贫穷，也使人富足；使人卑微，也使人高贵。 The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 他从灰尘里抬举贫寒人，从粪堆中提拔穷乏人，使他们与王子同坐，得着荣耀的座位。地的柱子属于耶和华，他将世界立在其上。 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他必保护圣民的脚步，使恶人在黑暗中寂然不动；人都不能靠力量得胜。 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 与耶和华争竞的，必被打碎，耶和华必从天上以雷攻击他；必审判地极的人，将力量赐与所立的王，高举受膏者的角。” The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 以利加拿往拉玛回家去了。那孩子在祭司以利面前事奉耶和华。 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 以利的两个儿子是恶人，不认识耶和华。 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 这二祭司待百姓是这样的规矩：凡有人献祭，正煮肉的时候，祭司的仆人就来，手拿三齿的叉子； And the priests' custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 将叉子往罐里，或鼎里，或釜里，或锅里一插，插上来的肉，祭司都取了去。凡上到示罗的以色列人，他们都是这样看待。 And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 又在未烧脂油以前，祭司的仆人就来对献祭的人说：“将肉给祭司叫他烤吧！他不要煮过的，要生的。” Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 献祭的人若说：“必须先烧脂油，然后你可以随意取肉。”仆人就说：“你立时给我，不然我便抢去。” And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 如此，这二少年人的罪在耶和华面前甚重了，因为他们藐视耶和华的祭物(或作“他们使人厌弃给耶和华献祭”)。 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 那时撒母耳还是孩子，穿着细麻布的以弗得，侍立在耶和华面前。 But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他母亲每年为他作一件小外袍，同着丈夫上来献年祭的时候，带来给他。 Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 以利为以利加拿和他的妻祝福，说：“愿耶和华由这妇人再赐你后裔，代替你从耶和华求来的孩子。”他们就回本乡去了。 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 耶和华眷顾哈拿，她就怀孕生了三个儿子，两个女儿。那孩子撒母耳，在耶和华面前渐渐长大。 And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 以利年甚老迈，听见他两个儿子待以色列众人的事，又听见他们与会幕门前伺候的妇人苟合。 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 他就对他们说：“你们为何行这样的事呢？我从这众百姓听见你们的恶行。 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 我儿啊！不可这样。我听见你们的风声不好，你们使耶和华的百姓犯了罪！ Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD's people to transgress.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 人若得罪人，有士师审判他；人若得罪耶和华，谁能为他祈求呢？”然而他们还是不听父亲的话，因为耶和华想要杀他们。 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 孩子撒母耳渐渐长大，耶和华与人越发喜爱他。 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 有神人来见以利，对他说：“耶和华如此说：‘你祖父在埃及法老家作奴仆的时候，我不是向他们显现吗？ And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 在以色列众支派中，我不是拣选人作我的祭司，使他烧香，在我坛上献祭，在我面前穿以弗得，又将以色列人所献的火祭，都赐给你父家吗？ And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 我所吩咐献在我居所的祭物，你们为何践踏？尊重你的儿子过于尊重我，将我民以色列所献美好的祭物肥己呢？” Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 因此，耶和华以色列的　神说：‘我曾说，你和你父家必永远行在我面前；现在我却说，决不容你们这样行。因为尊重我的，我必重看他；藐视我的，他必被轻视。 Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 日子必到，我要折断你的膀臂和你父家的膀臂，使你家中没有一个老年人。 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 在　神使以色列人享福的时候，你必看见我居所的败落；在你家中必永远没有一个老年人。 And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 我必不从我坛前灭尽你家中的人，那未灭的必使你眼目干瘪，心中忧伤；你家中所生的人都必死在中年。 And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 你的两个儿子何弗尼、非尼哈所遭遇的事，可作你的证据，他们二人必一日同死。 And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 我要为自己立一个忠心的祭司，他必照我的心意而行。我要为他建立坚固的家，他必永远行在我的受膏者面前。 And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 你家所剩下的人，都必来叩拜他，求块银子，求个饼，说：‘求你赐我祭司的职分，好叫我得点饼吃。’” And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_3">撒母耳记上 3</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 童子撒母耳在以利面前事奉耶和华。当那些日子，耶和华的言语稀少，不常有默示。 And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 一日，以利睡卧在自己的地方，他眼目昏花，看不分明。 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 　神的灯在　神耶和华殿内约柜那里，还没有熄灭，撒母耳已经睡了。 And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 耶和华呼唤撒母耳。撒母耳说：“我在这里。” That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 就跑到以利那里，说：“你呼唤我，我在这里。”以利回答说：“我没有呼唤你，你去睡吧！”他就去睡了。 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 耶和华又呼唤撒母耳。撒母耳起来，到以利那里，说：“你呼唤我，我在这里。”以利回答说：“我的儿，我没有呼唤你，你去睡吧！” And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 那时撒母耳还未认识耶和华，也未得耶和华的默示。 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 耶和华第三次呼唤撒母耳。撒母耳起来，到以利那里，说：“你又呼唤我，我在这里。”以利才明白是耶和华呼唤童子。 And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 因此，以利对撒母耳说：“你仍去睡吧！若再呼唤你，你就说：‘耶和华啊！请说。仆人敬听。’”撒母耳就去仍睡在原处。 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 耶和华又来站着，象前三次呼唤说：“撒母耳啊！撒母耳啊！”撒母耳回答说：“请说。仆人敬听。” And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 耶和华对撒母耳说：“我在以色列中必行一件事，叫听见的人都必耳鸣。 And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 我指着以利家所说的话，到了时候，我必始终应验在以利身上。 In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我曾告诉他必永远降罚与他的家，因他知道儿子作孽，自招咒诅，却不禁止他们。 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 所以我向以利家起誓说：以利家的罪孽，虽献祭奉礼物，永不能得赎去。” And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 撒母耳睡到天亮，就开了耶和华的殿门，不敢将默示告诉以利。 And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 以利呼唤撒母耳说：“我儿撒母耳啊！”撒母耳回答说：“我在这里。” Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 以利说：“耶和华对你说什么？你不要向我隐瞒；你若将　神对你所说的隐瞒一句，愿他重重地降罚与你。” And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 撒母耳就把一切话都告诉了以利，并没有隐瞒。以利说：“这是出于耶和华，愿他凭自己的意旨而行。” And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 撒母耳长大了，耶和华与他同在，使他所说的话，一句都不落空。 And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 从但到别是巴所有的以色列人，都知道耶和华立撒母耳为先知。 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 耶和华又在示罗显现，因为耶和华将自己的话默示撒母耳，撒母耳就把这话传遍以色列地。 And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_4">撒母耳记上 4</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 以色列人出去与非利士人打仗，安营在以便以谢；非利士人安营在亚弗。 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 非利士人向以色列人摆阵。两军交战的时候，以色列人败在非利士人面前。非利士人在战场上杀了他们的军兵，约有四千人。 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 百姓回到营里，以色列的长老说：“耶和华今日为何使我们败在非利士人面前呢？我们不如将耶和华的约柜，从示罗抬到我们这里来，好在我们中间救我们脱离敌人的手。” And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 于是百姓打发人到示罗，从那里将坐在二基路伯上万军之耶和华的约柜抬来。以利的两个儿子何弗尼、非尼哈，与　神的约柜同来。 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 耶和华的约柜到了营中，以色列众人就大声欢呼，地便震动。 And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 非利士人听见欢呼的声音，就说：“在希伯来人营里大声欢呼，是什么缘故呢？”随后就知道耶和华的约柜到了营中。 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 非利士人就惧怕起来，说：“有神到了他们营中。”又说：“我们有祸了！向来不曾有这样的事。 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 我们有祸了，谁能救我们脱离这些大能之神的手呢？从前在旷野用各样灾殃击打埃及人的，就是这些神。 Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 非利士人哪！你们要刚强，要作大丈夫，免得作希伯来人的奴仆，如同他们作你们的奴仆一样。你们要作大丈夫与他们争战。” Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 非利士人和以色列人打仗，以色列人败了，各向各家奔逃。被杀的人甚多，以色列的步兵仆倒了三万。 And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 　神的约柜被掳去，以利的两个儿子何弗尼、非尼哈，也都被杀了。 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 当日，有一个便雅悯人从阵上逃跑，衣服撕裂，头蒙灰尘，来到示罗。 And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 到了的时候，以利正在道旁坐在自己的位上观望，为　神的约柜心里担忧。那人进城报信，合城的人就都呼喊起来。 And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 以利听见呼喊的声音就问说：“这喧嚷是什么缘故呢？”那人急忙来报信给以利。 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 那时以利九十八岁了，眼目发直，不能看见。 Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 那人对以利说：“我是从阵上来的，今日我从阵上逃回。”以利说：“我儿，事情怎样？” And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 报信的回答说：“以色列人在非利士人面前逃跑，民中被杀的甚多！你的两个儿子何弗尼、非尼哈也都死了，并且　神的约柜被掳去。” And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 他一提　神的约柜，以利就从他的位上往后跌倒，在门旁折断颈项而死；因为他年纪老迈，身体沉重。以利作以色列的士师四十年。 And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 以利的儿妇非尼哈的妻怀孕将到产期，她听见　神的约柜被掳去，公公和丈夫都死了，就猛然疼痛，曲身生产。 And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 将要死的时候，旁边站着的妇人们对她说：“不要怕！你生了男孩子了。”她却不回答，也不放在心上。 And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 她给孩子起名叫以迦博。说：“荣耀离开以色列了！”这是因　神的约柜被掳去，又因她公公和丈夫都死了。 And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 她又说：“荣耀离开以色列！因为　神的约柜被掳去了。” And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_5">撒母耳记上 5</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 非利士人将　神的约柜从以便以谢抬到亚实突。 And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 非利士人将　神的约柜抬进大衮庙，放在大衮的旁边。 When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 次日清早，亚实突人起来，见大衮仆倒在耶和华的约柜前，脸伏于地，就把大衮仍立在原处。 And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 又次日清早起来，见大衮仆倒在耶和华的约柜前，脸伏于地，并且大衮的头和两手都在门槛上折断，只剩下大衮的残体。 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 因此，大衮的祭司和一切进亚实突大衮庙的人都不踏大衮庙的门槛，直到今日。 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 耶和华的手重重加在亚实突人身上，败坏他们，使他们生痔疮。亚实突和亚实突的四境，都是如此。 But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 亚实突人见这光景，就说：“以色列　神的约柜不可留在我们这里，因为他的手重重加在我们和我们神大衮的身上。” And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 就打发人去请非利士的众首领来聚集，问他们说：“我们向以色列　神的约柜应当怎样行呢？”他们回答说：“可以将以色列　神的约柜运到迦特去。”于是将以色列　神的约柜运到那里去。 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 运到之后，耶和华的手攻击那城，使那城的人大大惊慌，无论大小都生痔疮。 And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 他们就把　神的约柜送到以革伦。　神的约柜到了，以革伦人就喊嚷起来说：“他们将以色列　神的约柜运到我们这里，要害我们和我们的众民！” Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 于是打发人去请非利士的众首领来，说：“愿你们将以色列　神的约柜送回原处，免得害了我们和我们的众民。”原来　神的手重重攻击那城，城中的人有因惊慌而死的； So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 未曾死的人都生了痔疮。合城呼号，声音上达于天。 And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_6">撒母耳记上 6</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶和华的约柜在非利士人之地七个月。 And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 非利士人将祭司和占卜的聚了来，问他们说：“我们向耶和华的约柜应当怎样行？请指示我们用何法将约柜送回原处？” And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 他们说：“若要将以色列　神的约柜送回去，不可空空地送去，必要给他献赔罪的礼物，然后你们可得痊愈，并知道他的手为何不离开你们。” And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 非利士人说：“应当用什么献为赔罪的礼物呢？”他们回答说：“当照非利士首领的数目，用五个金痔疮，五个金老鼠，因为在你们众人和你们首领的身上，都是一样的灾。 Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 所以，当制造你们痔疮的像和毁坏你们田地老鼠的像，并要归荣耀给以色列的　神。或者他向你们和你们的神，并你们的田地，把手放轻些。 Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 你们为何硬着心象埃及人和法老一样呢？　神在埃及人中间行奇事，埃及人岂不释放以色列人，他们就去了吗？ Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 现在你们应当造一辆新车，将两只未曾负轭有乳的母牛，套在车上，使牛犊回家去离开母牛。 Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 把耶和华的约柜放在车上，将所献赔罪的金物装在匣子里，放在柜旁，将柜送去。 And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 你们要看看；车若直行以色列的境界到伯示麦去，这大灾就是耶和华降在我们身上的；若不然，便可以知道不是他的手击打我们，是我们偶然遇见的。” And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 非利士人就这样行，将两只有乳的母牛套在车上，将牛犊关在家里。 And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 把耶和华的约柜和装金老鼠并金痔疮像的匣子都放在车上。 And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 牛直行大道，往伯示麦去，一面走一面叫，不偏左右。非利士的首领跟在后面，直到伯示麦的境界。 And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 伯示麦人正在平原收割麦子，举目看见约柜，就欢喜了。 And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 车到了伯示麦人约书亚的田间，就站住了。在那里有一块大磐石，他们把车劈了，将两只母牛献给耶和华为燔祭。 And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 利未人将耶和华的约柜和装金物的匣子拿下来放在大磐石上。当日伯示麦人将燔祭和平安祭献给耶和华。 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 非利士人的五个首领看见，当日就回以革伦去了。 And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 非利士人献给耶和华作赔罪的金痔疮像，就是这些；一个是为亚实突、一个是为迦萨、一个是为亚实基伦、一个是为迦特、一个是为以革伦。 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 金老鼠的数目，是照非利士五个首领的城邑，就是坚固的城邑和乡村，以及大磐石；这磐石是放耶和华约柜的，到今日还在伯示麦人约书亚的田间。 And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 耶和华因伯示麦人擅观他的约柜，就击杀了他们七十人；那时有五万人在那里(原文作“七十人加五万人”)。百姓因耶和华大大击杀他们，就哀哭了。 And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 伯示麦人说：“谁能在耶和华这圣洁的　神面前侍立呢？这约柜可以从我们这里送到谁那里去呢？” And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God?

And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 非利士人听见以色列人聚集在米斯巴，非利士的首领就上来要攻击以色列人，以色列人听见，就惧怕非利士人。 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 以色列人对撒母耳说：“愿你不住地为我们呼求耶和华我们的　神，救我们脱离非利士人的手。” And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 撒母耳就把一只吃奶的羊羔，献与耶和华作全牲的燔祭，为以色列人呼求耶和华，耶和华就应允他。 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 撒母耳正献燔祭的时候，非利士人前来要与以色列人争战。当日，耶和华大发雷声，惊乱非利士人，他们就败在以色列人面前。 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 以色列人从米斯巴出来，追赶非利士人，击杀他们直到伯甲的下边。 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 撒母耳将一块石头，立在米斯巴和善的中间，给石头起名叫以便以谢，说：“到如今耶和华都帮助我们！” Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 从此非利士人就被制伏，不敢再入以色列人的境内。撒母耳作士师的时候，耶和华的手攻击非利士人。 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 非利士人所取以色列人的城邑，从以革伦直到迦特，都归以色列人了；属这些城的四境，以色列人也从非利士人手下收回。那时，以色列人与亚摩利人和好。 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 撒母耳平生作以色列的士师。 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 他每年巡行到伯特利、吉甲、米斯巴，在这几处审判以色列人。 And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 随后回到拉玛，因为他的家在那里，也在那里审判以色列人，且为耶和华筑了一座坛。 And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_8">撒母耳记上 8</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 撒母耳年纪老迈，就立他儿子作以色列的士师。 And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 长子名叫约珥，次子名叫亚比亚，他们在别是巴作士师。 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 他儿子不行他的道，贪图财利，收受贿赂，屈枉正直。 And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 以色列的长老都聚集，来到拉玛见撒母耳。 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 对他说：“你年纪老迈了，你儿子不行你的道。现在求你为我们立一个王治理我们，象列国一样。” And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 撒母耳不喜悦他们说：“立一个王治理我们。”他就祷告耶和华。 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 耶和华对撒母耳说：“百姓向你说的一切话，你只管依从；因为他们不是厌弃你，乃是厌弃我，不要我作他们的王。 And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 自从我领他们出埃及到如今，他们常常离弃我，事奉别神。现在他们向你所行的，是照他们素来所行的。 According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 故此你要依从他们的话，只是当警戒他们，告诉他们将来那王怎样管辖他们。” Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 撒母耳将耶和华的话，都传给求他立王的百姓，说： And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: “管辖你们的王必这样行：他必派你们的儿子为他赶车、跟马、奔走在车前； And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 又派他们作千夫长、五十夫长，为他耕种田地，收割庄稼，打造军器和车上的器械； And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 必取你们的女儿为他制造香膏，作饭烤饼； And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 也必取你们最好的田地、葡萄园、橄榄园，赐给他的臣仆； And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 你们的粮食和葡萄园所出的，他必取十分之一，给他的太监和臣仆； And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 又必取你们的仆人婢女，健壮的少年人和你们的驴，供他的差役； And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 你们的羊群他必取十分之一，你们也必作他的仆人。 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 那时你们必因所选的王哀求耶和华，耶和华却不应允你们。” And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 百姓竟不肯听撒母耳的话，说：“不然！我们定要一个王治理我们， Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 使我们象列国一样：有王治理我们，统领我们，为我们争战。” That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 撒母耳听见百姓这一切话，就将这话陈明在耶和华面前。 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 耶和华对撒母耳说：“你只管依从他们的话，为他们立王。”撒母耳对以色列人说：“你们各归各城去吧！” And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king.

And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 扫罗就走过以法莲山地，又过沙利沙地，都没有找着；又过沙琳地，驴也不在那里；又过便雅悯地，还没有找着。 And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 到了苏弗地，扫罗对跟随他的仆人说：“我们不如回去，恐怕我父亲不为驴挂心，反为我们担忧。” And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 仆人说：“这城里有一位神人，是众人所尊重的，凡他所说的全都应验。我们不如往他那里去，或者他能将我们当走的路指示我们。” And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 扫罗对仆人说：“我们若去，有什么可以送那人呢？我们囊中的食物都吃尽了，也没有礼物可以送那神人，我们还有什么没有？” Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 仆人回答扫罗说：“我手里有银子一舍客勒的四分之一，可以送那神人，请他指示我们当走的路。” And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: (从前以色列中，若有人去问　神，就说，我们问先见去吧！现在称为先知的，从前称为先见。) (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 扫罗对仆人说：“你说的是，我们可以去。”于是他们往神人所住的城里去了。 Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go.

And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 众人从邱坛下来进城，撒母耳和扫罗在房顶上说话。 And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 次日清早起来，黎明的时候，扫罗在房顶上。撒母耳呼叫他，说：“起来吧！我好送你回去。”扫罗就起来，和撒母耳一同出去。 And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 二人下到城角，撒母耳对扫罗说：“要吩咐仆人先走。(仆人就先走了)你且站在这里，等我将　神的话传与你听。” And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_10">撒母耳记上 10</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 撒母耳拿瓶膏油倒在扫罗的头上，与他亲嘴，说：“这不是耶和华膏你作他产业的君吗？ Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 你今日与我离别之后，在便雅悯境内的泄撒，靠近拉结的坟墓，要遇见两个人。他们必对你说：‘你去找的那几头驴已经找着了。现在你父亲不为驴挂心，反为你担忧。说：“我为儿子怎么才好呢？”’ When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 你从那里往前行，到了他泊的橡树那里，必遇见三个往伯特利去拜　神的人：一个带着三只山羊羔，一个带着三个饼，一个带着一皮袋酒。 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他们必问你安，给你两个饼，你就从他们手中接过来。 And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 此后你到　神的山，在那里有非利士人的防兵。你到了城的时候，必遇见一班先知从邱坛下来，前面有鼓瑟的、击鼓的、吹笛的、弹琴的，他们都受感说话。 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 耶和华的灵必大大感动你，你就与他们一同受感说话；你要变为新人。 And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 这兆头临到你，你就可以趁时而作，因为　神与你同在。 And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 你当在我以先下到吉甲，我也必下到那里献燔祭和平安祭。你要等候七日，等我到了那里，指示你当行的事。” And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 扫罗转身离别撒母耳，　神就赐他一个新心。当日这一切兆头都应验了。 And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 扫罗到了那山，有一班先知遇见他，　神的灵大大感动他，他就在先知中受感说话。 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 素来认识扫罗的，看见他和先知一同受感说话，就彼此说：“基士的儿子遇见什么了。”扫罗也列在先知中吗？” And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 那地方有一个人说：“这些人的父亲是谁呢？”此后有句俗语说：“扫罗也列在先知中吗？” And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 扫罗受感说话已毕，就上邱坛去了。 And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 扫罗的叔叔问扫罗和他仆人，说：“你们往哪里去了。”回答说：“找驴去了。我们见没有驴，就到了撒母耳那里。” And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye?

But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 撒母耳将百姓招聚到米斯巴耶和华那里， And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 对他们说：“耶和华以色列的　神如此说：‘我领你们以色列人出埃及，救你们脱离埃及人的手，又救你们脱离欺压你们各国之人的手。’ And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 你们今日却厌弃了救你们脱离一切灾难的　神，说：‘求你立一个王治理我们。’现在你们应当按着支派宗族，都站在耶和华面前。” And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 于是撒母耳使以色列众支派近前来掣签，就掣出便雅悯支派来； And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 又使便雅悯支派按着宗族近前来，就掣出玛特利族，从其中又掣出基士的儿子扫罗。众人寻找他却寻不着， When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 就问耶和华说：“那人到这里来了没有？”耶和华说：“他藏在器具中了。” Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 众人就跑去从那里领出他来。他站在百姓中间，身体比众民高过一头。 And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 撒母耳对众民说：“你们看耶和华所拣选的人，众民中有可比他的吗？”众民就大声欢呼说：“愿王万岁！” And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 撒母耳将国法对百姓说明，又记在书上放在耶和华面前，然后遣散众民，各回各家去了。 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 扫罗往基比亚回家去，有　神感动的一群人跟随他。 And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 但有些匪徒说：“这人怎能救我们呢？”就藐视他，没有送他礼物。扫罗却不理会。 But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us?

And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 以色列众人听见扫罗攻击非利士人的防营，又听见以色列人为非利士人所憎恶，就跟随扫罗聚集在吉甲。 And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 非利士人聚集要与以色列人争战，有车三万辆，马兵六千，步兵象海边的沙那样多，就上来在伯亚文东边的密抹安营。 And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 以色列百姓见自己危急窘迫，就藏在山洞、丛林、石穴、隐密处和坑中。 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 有些希伯来人过了约但河，逃到迦得和基列地。扫罗还是在吉甲，百姓都战战兢兢地跟随他。 And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 扫罗照着撒母耳所定的日期，等了七日。撒母耳还没有来到吉甲，百姓也离开扫罗散去了。 And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 扫罗说：“把燔祭和平安祭带到我这里来。”扫罗就献上燔祭。 And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings.

But he told not his father.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 扫罗在基比亚的尽边，坐在米矶仑的石榴树下，跟随他的约有六百人。 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 在那里有亚希突的儿子亚希亚，穿着以弗得。亚希突是以迦博的哥哥、非尼哈的儿子，以利的孙子。以利从前在示罗作耶和华的祭司。约拿单去了，百姓却不知道。 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 约拿单要从隘口过到非利士防营那里去。这隘口两边，各有一个山峰，一名播薛，一名西尼。 And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 一峰向北，与密抹相对；一峰向南，与迦巴相对。 The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 约拿单对拿兵器的少年人说：“我们不如过到未受割礼人的防营那里去，或者耶和华为我们施展能力，因为耶和华使人得胜，不在乎人多人少。” And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 拿兵器的对他说：“随你的心意行吧！你可以上去，我必跟随你，与你同心。” And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 约拿单说：“我们要过到那些人那里去，使他们看见我们。 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他们若对我们说：‘你们站住！等我们到你们那里去。’我们就站住，不上他们那里去。 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 他们若说：‘你们上到我们这里来！’这话就是我们的证据；我们便上去，因为耶和华将他们交在我们手里了。” But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 二人就使非利士的防兵看见。非利士人说：“希伯来人从所藏的洞穴里出来了！” And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 防兵对约拿单和拿兵器的人说：“你们上到这里来！我们有一件事指示你们。”约拿单就对拿兵器的人说：“你跟随我上去，因为耶和华将他们交在以色列人手里了。” And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 约拿单就爬上去，拿兵器的人跟随他。约拿单杀倒非利士人，拿兵器的人也随着杀他们。 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 约拿单和拿兵器的人，起头所杀的，约有二十人，都在一亩地的半犁沟之内。 And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 于是在营中、在田野、在众民内，都有战兢；防兵和掠兵也都战兢；地也震动，战兢之势甚大。 And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 在便雅悯的基比亚，扫罗的守望兵看见非利士的军众溃散，四围乱窜。 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 扫罗就对跟随他的民说：“你们查点查点，看从我们这里出去的是谁？”他们一查点，就知道约拿单和拿兵器的人没有在这里。 Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 那时　神的约柜在以色列人那里。扫罗对亚希亚说：“你将　神的约柜运了来。” And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 扫罗正与祭司说话的时候，非利士营中的喧嚷越发大了。扫罗就对祭司说：“停手吧！” And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 扫罗和跟随他的人都聚集，来到战场，看见非利士人用刀互相击杀，大大惶乱。 And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 从前由四方来跟随非利士军的希伯来人，现在也转过来，帮助跟随扫罗和约拿单的以色列人了。 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 那藏在以法莲山地的以色列人，听说非利士人逃跑，就出来紧紧地追杀他们。 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 那日耶和华使以色列人得胜，一直战到伯亚文。 So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 扫罗叫百姓起誓说，凡不等到晚上向敌人报完了仇吃什么的，必受咒诅。因此这日百姓没有吃什么，就极其困惫。 And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 众民进入树林，见有蜜在地上。 And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 他们进了树林，见有蜜流下来，却没有人敢用手取蜜入口，因为他们怕那誓言。 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 约拿单没有听见他父亲叫百姓起誓，所以伸手中的杖，用杖头蘸在蜂房里，转手送入口内，眼睛就明亮了。 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 百姓中有一人对他说：“你父亲曾叫百姓严严地起誓说，今日吃什么的，必受咒诅；因此百姓就疲乏了。” Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 约拿单说：“我父亲连累你们了。你看！我尝了这一点蜜，眼睛就明亮了。 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 今日百姓若任意吃了从仇敌所夺的物，击杀的非利士人，岂不更多吗？” How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 这日以色列人击杀非利士人，从密抹直到亚雅仑。百姓甚是疲乏， And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 就急忙将所夺的牛羊和牛犊，宰于地上，肉还带血就吃了。 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 有人告诉扫罗说：“百姓吃带血的肉，得罪耶和华了！”扫罗说：“你们有罪了！今日要将大石头滚到我这里来。” Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 扫罗又说：“你们散在百姓中，对他们说，你们各人将牛羊牵到我这里来宰了吃，不可吃带血的肉，得罪耶和华。”这夜百姓就把牛羊牵到那里宰了。 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 扫罗为耶和华筑了一座坛，这是他初次为耶和华筑的坛。 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 扫罗说：“我们不如夜里下去追赶非利士人，抢掠他们，直到天亮，不留他们一人。”众民说：“你看怎样好就去行吧！”祭司说：“我们先当亲近　神。” And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 扫罗求问　神说：“我下去追赶非利士人可以不可以？你将他们交在以色列人手里不交？”这日　神没有回答他。 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 扫罗说：“你们百姓中的长老都上这里来，查明今日是谁犯了罪。 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 我指着救以色列永生的耶和华起誓，就是我儿子约拿单犯了罪，他也必死。”但百姓中无一人回答他。 For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 扫罗就对以色列众人说：“你们站在一边，我与我儿子约拿单也站在一边，”百姓对扫罗说：“你看怎样好就去行吧！” Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 扫罗祷告耶和华以色列的　神说：“求你指示实情。”于是掣签掣出扫罗和约拿单来；百姓尽都无事。 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 扫罗说：“你们再掣签，看是我？是我儿子约拿单？”就掣出约拿单来。 And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 扫罗对约拿单说：“你告诉我你作了什么事？”约拿单说：“我实在以手里的杖，用杖头蘸了一点蜜尝了一尝。这样我就死吗(“吗”或作“吧”)？” Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 扫罗说：“约拿单哪！你定要死；若不然，愿　神重重地降罚与我。” And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 百姓对扫罗说：“约拿单在以色列人中这样大行拯救，岂可使他死呢？断乎不可！我们指着永生的耶和华起誓，连他的一根头发也不可落地，因为他今日与　神一同作事。”于是百姓救约拿单免了死亡。 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 扫罗回去，不追赶非利士人；非利士人也回本地去了。 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 扫罗执掌以色列的国权，常常攻击他四围的一切仇敌，就是摩押人、亚扪人、以东人，和琐巴诸王，并非利士人。他无论往何处去，都打败仇敌。 So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 扫罗奋勇攻击亚玛力人，救了以色列人脱离抢掠他们之人的手。 And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 扫罗的儿子是约拿单、亦施韦、麦基舒亚。他的两个女儿，长女名米拉，次女名米甲。 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 扫罗的妻，名叫亚希暖，是亚希玛斯的女儿。扫罗的元帅，名叫押尼珥，是尼珥的儿子。尼珥是扫罗的叔叔。 And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: 扫罗的父亲基士，押尼珥的父亲尼珥，都是亚别的儿子。 And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">52: 扫罗平生常与非利士人大大争战。扫罗遇见有能力的人或勇士，都招募了来跟随他。 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_15">撒母耳记上 15</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 撒母耳对扫罗说：“耶和华差遣我膏你为王，治理他的百姓以色列，所以你当听从耶和华的话。 Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 万军之耶和华如此说：‘以色列人出埃及的时候，在路上亚玛力人怎样待他们，怎样抵挡他们，我都没忘。 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 现在你要去击打亚玛力人，灭尽他们所有的，不可怜惜他们；将男女、孩童、吃奶的，并牛、羊、骆驼和驴，尽行杀死。’” Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 于是扫罗招聚百姓在提拉因，数点他们，共有步兵二十万，另有犹大人一万。 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 扫罗到了亚玛力的京城，在谷中设下埋伏。 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 扫罗对基尼人说：“你们离开亚玛力人下去吧！恐怕我将你们和亚玛力人一同杀灭；因为以色列人出埃及的时候，你们曾恩待他们。”于是基尼人离开亚玛力人去了。 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 扫罗击打亚玛力人，从哈腓拉直到埃及前的书珥。 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 生擒了亚玛力王亚甲，用刀杀尽亚玛力的众民。 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 扫罗和百姓却怜惜亚甲，也爱惜上好的牛、羊、牛犊、羊羔并一切美物，不肯灭绝；凡下贱瘦弱的，尽都杀了。 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 耶和华的话临到撒母耳说： Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: “我立扫罗为王，我后悔了；因为他转去不跟从我，不遵守我的命令。”撒母耳便甚忧愁，终夜哀求耶和华。 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 撒母耳清早起来，迎接扫罗。有人告诉撒母耳说：“扫罗到了迦密，在那里立了纪念碑，又转身下到吉甲。” And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 撒母耳到了扫罗那里，扫罗对他说：“愿耶和华赐福与你，耶和华的命令我已遵守了。” And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 撒母耳说：“我耳中听见有羊叫、牛鸣，是从哪里来的呢？” And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 扫罗说：“这是百姓从亚玛力人那里带来的，因为他们爱惜上好的牛羊，要献与耶和华你的　神；其余的我们都灭尽了。” And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 撒母耳对扫罗说：“你住口吧！等我将耶和华昨夜向我所说的话告诉你。”扫罗说：“请讲。” Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 撒母耳对扫罗说：“从前你虽然以自己为小，岂不是被立为以色列支派的元首吗？耶和华膏你作以色列的王。 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 耶和华差遣你，吩咐你说，你去击打那些犯罪的亚玛力人，将他们灭绝净尽。 And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 你为何没有听从耶和华的命令，急忙掳掠财物，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事呢？” Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 扫罗对撒母耳说：“我实在听从了耶和华的命令，行了耶和华所差遣我行的路，擒了亚玛力王亚甲来，灭尽了亚玛力人。 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 百姓却在所当灭的物中，取了最好的牛羊，要在吉甲献与耶和华你的　神。” But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 撒母耳说：“耶和华喜悦燔祭和平安祭，岂如喜悦人听从他的话呢？听命胜于献祭，顺从胜于公羊的脂油。 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 悖逆的罪，与行邪术的罪相等；顽梗的罪，与拜虚神和偶像的罪相同。你既厌弃耶和华的命令，耶和华也厌弃你作王。” For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 扫罗对撒母耳说：“我有罪了！我因惧怕百姓，听从他们的话，就违背了耶和华的命令和你的言语。 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 现在求你赦免我的罪，同我回去，我好敬拜耶和华。” Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 撒母耳对扫罗说：“我不同你回去，因为你厌弃耶和华的命令，耶和华也厌弃你作以色列的王。” And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 撒母耳转身要走，扫罗就扯住他外袍的衣襟，衣襟就撕断了。 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 撒母耳对他说：“如此，今日耶和华使以色列国与你断绝，将这国赐与比你更好的人； And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 以色列的大能者，必不至说谎，也不至后悔。因为他迥非世人，决不后悔。” And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 扫罗说：“我有罪了！虽然如此，求你在我百姓的长老和以色列人面前抬举我，同我回去，我好敬拜耶和华你的　神。” Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 于是撒母耳转身跟随扫罗回去，扫罗就敬拜耶和华。 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 撒母耳说：“要把亚玛力王亚甲带到我这里来！”亚甲就欢欢喜喜地来到他面前，心里说，死亡的苦难必定过去了。 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 撒母耳说：“你既用刀使妇人丧子；这样，你母亲在妇人中也必丧子。”于是撒母耳在吉甲耶和华面前，将亚甲杀死。 And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 撒母耳回了拉玛。扫罗上他所住的基比亚回自己的家去了。 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 撒母耳直到死的日子，再没有见扫罗；但撒母耳为扫罗悲伤，是因耶和华后悔立他为以色列的王。 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_16">撒母耳记上 16</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶和华对撒母耳说：“我既厌弃扫罗作以色列的王，你为他悲伤要到几时呢？你将膏油盛满了角，我差遣你往伯利恒人耶西那里去，因为我在他众子之内，预定一个作王的。” And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 撒母耳说：“我怎能去呢？扫罗若听见，必要杀我。”耶和华说：“你可以带一只牛犊去，就说：‘我来是要向耶和华献祭。’ And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 你要请耶西来吃祭肉，我就指示你所当行的事。我所指给你的人，你要膏他。” And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 撒母耳就照耶和华的话去行。到了伯利恒，那城里的长老都战战兢兢地出来迎接他，问他说：“你是为平安来的吗？” And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他说：“为平安来的，我是给耶和华献祭。你们当自洁，来与我同吃祭肉。”撒母耳就使耶西和他众子自洁，请他们来吃祭肉。 And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他们来的时候，撒母耳看见以利押，就心里说，耶和华的受膏者必定在他面前。 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 耶和华却对撒母耳说：“不要看他的外貌和他身材高大，我不拣选他，因为耶和华不象人看人，人是看外貌，耶和华是看内心。” But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 耶西叫亚比拿达从撒母耳面前经过，撒母耳说：“耶和华也不拣选他。” Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 耶西又叫沙玛从撒母耳面前经过，撒母耳说：“耶和华也不拣选他。” Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 耶西叫他七个儿子都从撒母耳面前经过，撒母耳说：“这都不是耶和华所拣选的。” Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 撒母耳对耶西说：“你的儿子都在这里吗？”他回答说：“还有个小的，现在放羊。”撒母耳对耶西说：“你打发人去叫他来；他若不来，我们必不坐席。” And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 耶西就打发人去叫了他来。他面色光红，双目清秀，容貌俊美。耶和华说：“这就是他，你起来膏他。” And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 撒母耳就用角里的膏油，在他诸兄中膏了他。从这日起，耶和华的灵就大大感动大卫。撒母耳起身回拉玛去了。 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 耶和华的灵离开扫罗，有恶魔从耶和华那里来扰乱他。 But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 扫罗的臣仆对他说：“现在有恶魔从　神那里来扰乱你。 And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 我们的主可以吩咐面前的臣仆，找一个善于弹琴的来，等　神那里来的恶魔临到你身上的时候，使他用手弹琴，你就好了。” Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 扫罗对臣仆说：“你们可以为我找一个善于弹琴的，带到我这里来。” And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 其中有一个少年人说：“我曾见伯利恒人耶西的一个儿子，善于弹琴；是大有勇敢的战士，说话合宜，容貌俊美，耶和华也与他同在。” Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 于是扫罗差遣使者去见耶西，说：“请你打发你放羊的儿子大卫到我这里来。” Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 耶西就把几个饼和一皮袋酒，并一只山羊羔都驮在驴上，交给他儿子大卫，送与扫罗。 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 大卫到了扫罗那里，就侍立在扫罗面前。扫罗甚喜爱他，他就作了扫罗拿兵器的人。 And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 扫罗差遣人去见耶西说：“求你容大卫侍立在我面前，因为他在我眼前蒙了恩。” And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 从　神那里来的恶魔临到扫罗身上的时候，大卫就拿琴用手而弹，扫罗便舒畅爽快，恶魔离了他。 And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_17">撒母耳记上 17</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 非利士人招聚他们的军旅，要来争战；聚集在属犹大的梭哥，安营在梭哥和亚西加中间的以弗大悯。 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 扫罗和以色列人也聚集，在以拉谷安营，摆列队伍，要与非利士人打仗。 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 非利士人站在这边山上，以色列人站在那边山上，当中有谷。 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 从非利士营中出来一个讨战的人，名叫歌利亚；是迦特人，身高六肘零一虎口。 And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 头戴铜盔，身穿铠甲，甲重五千舍客勒。 And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 腿上有铜护膝，两肩之中背负铜戟； And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 枪杆粗如织布的机轴，铁枪头重六百舍客勒。有一个拿盾牌的人在他前面走。 And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 歌利亚对着以色列的军队站立，呼叫说：“你们出来摆列队伍作什么呢？我不是非利士人吗？你们不是扫罗的仆人吗？可以从你们中间拣选一人，使他下到我这里来。 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array?

for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 百姓照先前的话回答他说：“有人能杀这非利士人，必如此如此待他。” And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 大卫的长兄以利押，听见大卫与他们所说的话，就向他发怒，说：“你下来作什么呢？在旷野的那几只羊，你交托了谁呢？我知道你的骄傲和你心里的恶意；你下来，特为要看争战。” And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither?

I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 大卫说：“我作了什么呢？我来岂没有缘故吗？” And David said, What have I now done?

And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 扫罗就把自己的战衣给大卫穿上，将铜盔给他戴上，又给他穿上铠甲。 And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 大卫把刀跨在战衣外，试试能走不能走，因为素来没有穿惯，就对扫罗说：“我穿戴这些不能走，因为素来没有穿惯。”于是摘脱了。 And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 他手中拿杖，又在溪中挑选了五块光滑石子，放在袋里，就是牧人带的囊里；手中拿着甩石的机弦，就去迎那非利士人。 And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 非利士人也渐渐地迎着大卫来，拿盾牌的走在前头。 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 非利士人观看，见了大卫，就藐视他；因为他年轻，面色光红，容貌俊美。 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 非利士人对大卫说：“你拿杖到我这里来，我岂是狗呢？”非利士人就指着自己的神，咒诅大卫。 And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 非利士人又对大卫说：“来吧！我将你的肉给空中的飞鸟，田野的走兽吃。” And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 大卫对非利士人说：“你来攻击我，是靠着刀枪和铜戟；我来攻击你，是靠着万军之耶和华的名，就是你所怒骂带领以色列军队的　神。 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 今日耶和华必将你交在我手里。我必杀你，斩你的头；又将非利士军兵的尸首，给空中的飞鸟地上的野兽吃，使普天下的人都知道以色列中有　神。 This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 又使这众人知道耶和华使人得胜，不是用刀用枪，因为争战的胜败全在乎耶和华。他必将你们交在我们手里。” And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 非利士人起身，迎着大卫前来；大卫急忙迎着非利士人，往战场跑去。 And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 大卫用手从囊中掏出一块石子来，用机弦甩去，打中非利士人的额；石子进入额内，他就仆倒，面伏于地。 And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 这样，大卫用机弦甩石，胜了那非利士人，打死他。大卫手中却没有刀。 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: 大卫跑去，站在非利士人身旁，将他的刀从鞘中拔出来，杀死他，割了他的头。非利士众人看见他们讨战的勇士死了，就都逃跑。 Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">52: 以色列人和犹大人便起身，呐喊，追赶非利士人，直到迦特(或作“该”)和以革伦的城门。被杀的非利士人，倒在沙拉音的路上，直到迦特和以革伦。 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">53: 以色列人追赶非利士人回来，就夺了他们的营盘。 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">54: 大卫将那非利士人的头，拿到耶路撒冷，却将他军装放在自己的帐棚里。 And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">55: 扫罗看见大卫去攻击非利士人，就问元帅押尼珥说：“押尼珥啊！那少年人是谁的儿子？”押尼珥说：“我敢在王面前起誓，我不知道。” And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">56: 王说：“你可以问问那幼年人是谁的儿子。” And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">57: 大卫打死非利士人回来，押尼珥领他到扫罗面前，他手中拿着非利士人的头。 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">58: 扫罗问他说：“少年人哪！你是谁的儿子？”大卫说：“我是你仆人伯利恒人耶西的儿子。” And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_18">撒母耳记上 18</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 大卫对扫罗说完了话，约拿单的心与大卫的心，深相契合。约拿单爱大卫，如同爱自己的性命。 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 那日扫罗留住大卫，不容他再回父家。 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 约拿单爱大卫如同爱自己的性命，就与他结盟。 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 约拿单从身上脱下外袍，给了大卫，又将战衣、刀、弓、腰带都给了他。 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 扫罗无论差遣大卫往何处去，他都作事精明。扫罗就立他作战士长，众百姓和扫罗的臣仆，无不喜悦。 And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 大卫打死了那非利士人，同众人回来的时候，妇女们从以色列各城里出来，欢欢喜喜，打鼓击磬，歌唱跳舞，迎接扫罗王。 And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 众妇女舞蹈唱和，说：“扫罗杀死千千，大卫杀死万万。” And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 扫罗甚发怒，不喜悦这话，就说：“将万万归大卫，千千归我，只剩下王位没有给他了。” And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 从这日起，扫罗就怒视大卫。 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 次日，从　神那里来的恶魔，大大降在扫罗身上，他就在家中胡言乱语。大卫照常弹琴，扫罗手里拿着枪。 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 扫罗把枪一抡，心里说，我要将大卫刺透，钉在墙上。大卫躲避他两次。 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 扫罗惧怕大卫，因为耶和华离开自己，与大卫同在。 And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 所以扫罗使大卫离开自己，立他为千夫长，他就领兵出入。 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 大卫作事无不精明，耶和华也与他同在。 And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 扫罗见大卫作事精明，就甚怕他。 Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 但以色列和犹大众人，都爱大卫，因为他领他们出入。 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 扫罗对大卫说：“我将大女儿米拉，给你为妻，只要你为我奋勇，为耶和华争战。”扫罗心里说：“我不好亲手害他，要借非利士人的手害他。 And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 大卫对扫罗说：“我是谁，我是什么出身，我父家在以色列中是何等的家，岂敢作王的女婿呢？” And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 扫罗的女儿米拉到了当给大卫的时候，扫罗却给了米何拉人亚得列为妻。 But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 扫罗的次女米甲爱大卫，有人告诉扫罗，扫罗就喜悦。 And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 扫罗心里说，我将这女儿给大卫，作他的网罗，好借非利士人的手害他。所以扫罗对大卫说：“你今日可以第二次作我的女婿。” And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 扫罗吩咐臣仆说：“你们暗中对大卫说，王喜悦你，王的臣仆也都喜爱你，所以你当作王的女婿。” And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 扫罗的臣仆，就照这话说给大卫听。大卫说：“你们以为作王的女婿，是一件小事吗？我是贫穷卑微的人。” And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 扫罗的臣仆回奏说，大卫所说的如此如此。 And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 扫罗说：“你们要对大卫这样说，王不要什么聘礼，只要一百非利士人的阳皮，好在王的仇敌身上报仇。”扫罗的意思要使大卫丧在非利士人的手里。 And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 扫罗的臣仆将这话告诉大卫，大卫就欢喜作王的女婿。日期还没有到， And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 大卫和跟随他的人起身前往，杀了二百非利士人，将阳皮满数交给王，为要作王的女婿。于是扫罗将女儿米甲给大卫为妻。 Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 扫罗见耶和华与大卫同在，又知道女儿米甲爱大卫。 And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 就更怕大卫，常作大卫的仇敌。 And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 每逢非利士军长出来打仗，大卫比扫罗的臣仆作事精明；因此他的名被人尊重。 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_19">撒母耳记上 19</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 扫罗对他儿子约拿单和众臣仆说，要杀大卫；扫罗的儿子约拿单却甚喜爱大卫。 And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 约拿单告诉大卫说：“我父扫罗想要杀你，所以明日早晨你要小心，到一个僻静地方藏身。 But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 我就出到你所藏的田里，站在我父亲旁边，与他谈论。我看他情形怎样，我必告诉你。” And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 约拿单向他父亲扫罗替大卫说好话，说：“王不可得罪王的仆人大卫，因为他未曾得罪你，他所行的，都与你大有益处。 And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他拚命杀那非利士人，耶和华为以色列众人大行拯救。那时你看见，甚是欢喜，现在为何无故要杀大卫，流无辜人的血，自己取罪呢？” For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 扫罗听了约拿单的话，就指着永生的耶和华起誓，说：“我必不杀他。” And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 约拿单叫大卫来，把这一切事告诉他，带他去见扫罗。他就仍然侍立在扫罗面前。 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 此后，又有争战的事。大卫出去，与非利士人打仗，大大杀败他们，他们就在他面前逃跑。 And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 从耶和华那里来的恶魔，又降在扫罗身上(扫罗手里拿枪坐在屋里)，大卫就用手弹琴。 And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 扫罗用枪想要刺透大卫，钉在墙上；他却躲开，扫罗的枪刺入墙内。当夜大卫逃走躲避了。 And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin, but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 扫罗打发人到大卫的房屋那里，窥探他，要等到天亮杀他。大卫的妻米甲对他说：“你今夜若不逃命，明日你要被杀。” Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 于是米甲将大卫从窗户里缒下去；大卫就逃走，躲避了。 So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 米甲把家中的神像放在床上，头枕在山羊毛装的枕头上，用被遮盖。 And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 扫罗打发人去捉拿大卫，米甲说：“他病了。” And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 扫罗又打发人去看大卫，说：“当连床将他抬来，我好杀他。” And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 使者进去，看见床上有神像，头枕在山羊毛装的枕头上。 And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 扫罗对米甲说：“你为什么这样欺哄我，放我仇敌逃走呢？”米甲回答说：“他对我说，你放我走；不然，我要杀你。” And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 大卫逃避，来到拉玛见撒母耳，将扫罗向他所行的事，述说了一遍。他和撒母耳就往拿约去居住。 So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 有人告诉扫罗，说大卫在拉玛的拿约。 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 扫罗打发人去捉拿大卫。去的人见有一班先知都受感说话，撒母耳站在其中监管他们；打发去的人，也受　神的灵感动说话。 And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 有人将这事告诉扫罗，他又打发人去，他们也受感说话。扫罗第三次打发人去，他们也受感说话。 And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 然后扫罗自己往拉玛去，到了西沽的大井，问人说：“撒母耳和大卫在哪里呢？”有人说：“在拉玛的拿约。” Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 他就往拉玛的拿约去。　神的灵也感动他，一面走，一面说话，直到拉玛的拿约。 And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 他就脱了衣服，在撒母耳面前受感说话，一昼一夜，露体躺卧。因此有句俗语说：“扫罗也列在先知中吗？” And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_20">撒母耳记上 20</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 大卫从拉玛的拿约逃跑，来到约拿单那里。对他说：“我作了什么？有什么罪孽呢？在你父亲面前犯了什么罪，他竟寻索我的性命呢？” And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 约拿单回答说：“断然不是！你必不至死。我父作事，无论大小，没有不叫我知道的。怎么独有这事隐瞒我呢？决不如此。” And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 大卫又起誓，说：“你父亲准知我在你眼前蒙恩。他心里说，不如不叫约拿单知道，恐怕他愁烦。我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我离死不过一步！” And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 约拿单对大卫说：“你心里所求的，我必为你成就。” Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 大卫对约拿单说：“明日是初一，我当与王同席，求你容我去藏在田野，直到第三日晚上。 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 你父亲若见我不在席上，你就说，大卫切求我许他回本城伯利恒去，因为他全家在那里献年祭。 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 你父亲若说好，仆人就平安了；他若发怒，你就知道他决意要害我。 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 求你施恩与仆人，因你在耶和华面前曾与仆人结盟。我若有罪，不如你自己杀我，何必将我交给你父亲呢？” Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 约拿单说：“断无此事！我若知道我父亲决意害你，我岂不告诉你呢？” And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 大卫对约拿单说：“你父亲若用厉言回答你，谁来告诉我呢？” Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 约拿单对大卫说：“你我且往田野去。”二人就往田野去了。 And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 约拿单对大卫说：“愿耶和华以色列的　神为证，明日约在这时候，或第三日，我探我父亲的意思，若向你有好意，我岂不打发人告诉你吗？ And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我父亲若有意害你，我不告诉你，使你平平安安地走，愿耶和华重重地降罚与我！愿耶和华与你同在，如同从前与我父亲同在一样。 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 你要照耶和华的慈爱恩待我，不但我活着的时候，免我死亡； And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 就是我死后，耶和华从地上剪除你仇敌的时候，你也永不可向我家绝了恩惠。” But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 于是约拿单与大卫家结盟，说：“愿耶和华借大卫的仇敌追讨背约的罪。” So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 约拿单因爱大卫如同爱自己的性命，就使他再起誓。 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 约拿单对他说：“明日是初一，你的座位空设，人必理会你不在那里。 Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 你等三日，就要速速下去，到你从前遇事所藏的地方，在以色磐石那里等候。 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 我要向磐石旁边射三箭，如同射箭靶一样。 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 我要打发童子说：‘去把箭找来。’我若对童子说：‘箭在后头，把箭拿来。’你就可以回来；我指着永生的耶和华起誓，你必平安无事； And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 我若对童子说：‘箭在前头。’你就要去，因为是耶和华打发你去的。 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 至于你我今日所说的话，有耶和华在你我中间为证，直到永远。” And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 大卫就去藏在田野。到了初一日，王坐席要吃饭。 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 王照常坐在靠墙的位上，约拿单侍立，押尼珥坐在扫罗旁边，大卫的座位空设。 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 然而这日扫罗没有说什么，他想大卫遇事，偶染不洁，他必定是不洁。 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 初二日大卫的座位还空设，扫罗问他儿子约拿单说：“耶西的儿子为何昨日今日，没有来吃饭呢？” And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 约拿单回答扫罗说：“大卫切求我容他往伯利恒去。 And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 他说，求你容我去，因为我家在城里有献祭的事，我长兄吩咐我去。如今我若在你眼前蒙恩，求你容我去见我的弟兄。所以大卫没有赴王的席。” And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 扫罗向约拿单发怒，对他说：“你这顽梗背逆之妇人所生的，我岂不知道你喜悦耶西的儿子，自取羞辱，以致你母亲露体蒙羞吗？ Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 耶西的儿子若在世间活着，你和你的国位必站立不住。现在你要打发人去，将他捉拿交给我。他是该死的！” For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 约拿单对父亲扫罗说：“他为什么该死呢？他作了什么呢？” And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 扫罗向约拿单抡枪要刺他，约拿单就知道他父亲决意要杀大卫。 And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 于是约拿单气忿忿地从席上起来，在这初二日没有吃饭。他因见父亲羞辱大卫，就为大卫愁烦。 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 次日早晨，约拿单按着与大卫约会的时候，出到田野，有一个童子跟随。 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 约拿单对童子说：“你跑去，把我所射的箭找来。”童子跑去，约拿单就把箭射在童子前头。 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 童子到了约拿单落箭之地，约拿单呼叫童子说：“箭不是在你前头吗？” And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 约拿单又呼叫童子说：“速速地去，不要迟延！”童子就拾起箭来，回到主人那里。 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 童子却不知道这是什么意思，只有约拿单和大卫知道。 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 约拿单将弓箭交给童子，吩咐说：“你拿到城里去。” And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 童子一去，大卫就从磐石的南边出来，俯伏在地，拜了三拜；二人亲嘴，彼此哭泣，大卫哭得更恸。 And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 约拿单对大卫说：“我们二人曾指着耶和华的名起誓，说：‘愿耶和华在你我中间，并你我后裔中间为证，直到永远。’如今你平平安安地去吧！”大卫就起身走了。约拿单也回城里去了。 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_21">撒母耳记上 21</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 大卫到了挪伯祭司亚希米勒那里，亚希米勒战战兢兢地出来迎接他，问他说：“你为什么独自来，没有人跟随呢？” Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 大卫回答祭司亚希米勒说：“王吩咐我一件事，说：‘我差遣你委托你的这件事，不要使人知道。’故此我已派定少年人在某处等候我。 And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 现在你手下有什么？求你给我五个饼，或是别样的食物。” Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 祭司对大卫说：“我手下没有寻常的饼，只有圣饼；若少年人没有亲近妇人，才可以给。” And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 大卫对祭司说：“实在约有三日我们没有亲近妇人；我出来的时候，虽是寻常行路，少年人的器皿还是洁净的；何况今日不更是洁净吗？” And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 祭司就拿圣饼给他，因为在那里没有别样饼，只有更换新饼，从耶和华面前撤下来的陈设饼。 So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 当日有扫罗的一个臣子留在耶和华面前。他名叫多益，是以东人，作扫罗的司牧长。 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 大卫问亚希米勒说：“你手下有枪有刀没有？因为王的事甚急，连刀剑器械我都没有带。” And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 祭司说：“你在以拉谷杀非利士人歌利亚的那刀在这里，裹在布中，放在以弗得后边，你要就可以拿去。除此以外，再没有别的。”大卫说：“这刀没有可比的！求你给我。” And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 那日大卫起来，躲避扫罗，逃到迦特王亚吉那里。 And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 亚吉的臣仆对亚吉说：“这不是以色列国王大卫吗？那里的妇女跳舞唱和，不是指着他说，扫罗杀死千千，大卫杀死万万吗？” And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 大卫将这话放在心里，甚惧怕迦特王亚吉； And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 就在众人面前改变了寻常的举动，在他们手下假装疯癫，在城门的门扇上胡写乱画，使唾沫流在胡子上。 And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 亚吉对臣仆说：“你们看！这人是疯子。为什么带他到我这里来呢？ Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 我岂缺少疯子，你们带这人来在我面前疯癫吗？这人岂可进我的家呢？” Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_22">撒母耳记上 22</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 大卫就离开那里，逃到亚杜兰洞。他的弟兄和他父亲的全家听见了，就都下到他那里。 David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 凡受窘迫的、欠债的、心里苦恼的，都聚集到大卫那里，大卫就作他们的头目；跟随他的约有四百人。 And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 大卫从那里往摩押的米斯巴去，对摩押王说：“求你容我父母搬来，住在你们这里，等我知道　神要为我怎样行。” And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 大卫领他父母到摩押王面前。大卫住山寨多少日子，他父母也住摩押王那里多少日子。 And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 先知迦得对大卫说：“你不要住在山寨，要往犹大地去。”大卫就离开那里，进入哈列的树林。 And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 扫罗在基比亚的拉玛，坐在垂丝柳树下，手里拿着枪，众臣仆侍立在左右。扫罗听见大卫和跟随他的人在何处， When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 就对左右侍立的臣仆说：“便雅悯人哪！你们要听我的话：耶西的儿子能将田地和葡萄园赐给你们各人吗？能立你们各人作千夫长、百夫长吗？ Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 你们竟都结党害我！我的儿子与耶西的儿子结盟的时候，无人告诉我；我的儿子挑唆我的臣子谋害我，就如今日的光景，也无人告诉我，为我忧虑！” That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 那时以东人多益站在扫罗的臣仆中，对他说：“我曾看见耶西的儿子到了挪伯亚希突的儿子亚希米勒那里。 Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 亚希米勒为他求问耶和华，又给他食物，并给他杀非利士人歌利亚的刀。” And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 王就打发人将祭司亚希突的儿子亚希米勒和他父亲的全家，就是住挪伯的祭司，都召了来。他们就来见王。 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 扫罗说：“亚希突的儿子，要听我的话。”他回答说：“主啊！我在这里。” And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 扫罗对他说：“你为什么与耶西的儿子结党害我？将食物和刀给他，又为他求问　神，使他起来谋害我，就如今日的光景！” And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 亚希米勒回答王说：“王的臣仆中，有谁比大卫忠心呢？他是王的女婿，又是王的参谋，并且在王家中是尊贵的。 Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 我岂是从今日才为他求问　神呢？断不是这样！王不要将罪归我和我父的全家；因为这事，无论大小，仆人都不知道。” Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 王说：“亚希米勒啊！你和你父的全家，都是该死的！” And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 王就吩咐左右的侍卫说：“你们去杀耶和华的祭司，因为他们帮助大卫；又知道大卫逃跑，竟没有告诉我。”扫罗的臣子却不肯伸手杀耶和华的祭司。 And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 王吩咐多益说：“你去杀祭司吧！”以东人多益就去杀祭司，那日杀了穿细麻布以弗得的八十五人。 And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 又用刀将祭司城挪伯中的男女、孩童、吃奶的，和牛、羊、驴，尽都杀灭。 And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 亚希突的儿子亚希米勒有一个儿子，名叫亚比亚他，逃到大卫那里。 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 亚比亚他将扫罗杀耶和华祭司的事告诉大卫。 And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 大卫对亚比亚他说：“那日我见以东人多益在那里，就知道他必告诉扫罗。你父的全家丧命，都是因我的缘故。 And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 你可以住在我这里，不要惧怕；因为寻索你命的，就是寻索我的命；你在我这里，可得保全。” Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_23">撒母耳记上 23</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 有人告诉大卫说：“非利士人攻击基伊拉，抢夺禾场。” Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 所以大卫求问耶和华说：“我去攻打那些非利士人，可以不可以？”耶和华对大卫说：“你可以去攻打非利士人，拯救基伊拉。” Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 跟随大卫的人对他说：“我们在犹大地这里尚且惧怕，何况往基伊拉去攻打非利士人的军旅呢？” And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 大卫又求问耶和华，耶和华回答说：“你起身，下基伊拉去，我必将非利士人交在你手里。” Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 大卫和跟随他的人往基伊拉去，与非利士人打仗，大大杀败他们，又夺获他们的牲畜。这样，大卫救了基伊拉的居民。 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 亚希米勒的儿子亚比亚他，逃到基伊拉见大卫的时候，手里拿着以弗得。 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 有人告诉扫罗说：“大卫到了基伊拉。”扫罗说：“他进了有门有闩的城，困闭在里头，这是　神将他交在我手里了。” And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 于是扫罗招聚众民，要下去攻打基伊拉城，围困大卫和跟随他的人。 And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 大卫知道扫罗设计谋害他，就对祭司亚比亚他说：“将以弗得拿过来。” And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 大卫祷告说：“耶和华以色列的　神啊！你仆人听真了扫罗要往基伊拉来，为我的缘故灭城。 Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 基伊拉人将我交在扫罗手里不交？扫罗照着你仆人所听的话下来不下来？耶和华以色列的　神啊！求你指示仆人。”耶和华说：“扫罗必下来。” Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 大卫又说：“基伊拉人将我和跟随我的人，交在扫罗手里不交？”耶和华说：“必交出来。” Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 大卫和跟随他的，约有六百人，就起身出了基伊拉，往他们所能往的地方去。有人告诉扫罗，大卫离开基伊拉逃走，于是扫罗不出来了。 Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 大卫住在旷野的山寨里，常在西弗旷野的山地。扫罗天天寻索大卫，　神却不将大卫交在他手里。 And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 大卫知道扫罗出来寻索他的命，那时他住在西弗旷野的树林里。 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 扫罗的儿子约拿单起身，往那树林里去见大卫，使他倚靠　神得以坚固。 And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 对他说：“不要惧怕！我父扫罗的手必不加害于你；你必作以色列的王，我也作你的宰相。这事我父扫罗知道了。” And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 于是二人在耶和华面前立约。大卫仍住在树林里，约拿单回家去了。 And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 西弗人上到基比亚见扫罗，说：“大卫不是在我们那里的树林里山寨中，旷野南边的哈基拉山藏着吗？ Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 王啊！请你随你的心愿下来，我们必亲自将他交在王的手里。” Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 扫罗说：“愿耶和华赐福与你们，因你们顾恤我。 And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 请你们回去，再确实查明他的住处和行踪，是谁看见他在那里；因为我听见人说他甚狡猾。 Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 所以要看准他藏匿的地方，回来据实地告诉我，我就与你们同去。他若在犹大的境内，我必从千门万户中搜出他来。” See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 西弗人就起身，在扫罗以先往西弗去。大卫和跟随他的人，却在玛云旷野南边的亚拉巴。 And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 扫罗和跟随他的人去寻找大卫。有人告诉大卫，他就下到磐石，住在玛云的旷野。扫罗听见，便在玛云的旷野，追赶大卫。 Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 扫罗在山这边走，大卫和跟随他的人在山那边走。大卫急忙躲避扫罗，因为扫罗和跟随他的人，四面围住大卫和跟随他的人，要拿获他们。 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 忽有使者来报告扫罗，说：“非利士人犯境抢掠，请王快快回去！” But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 于是扫罗不追赶大卫，回去攻打非利士人。因此那地方名叫西拉哈玛希罗结。 Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 大卫从那里上去，住在隐基底的山寨里。 And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_24">撒母耳记上 24</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 扫罗追赶非利士人回来，有人告诉他说：“大卫在隐基底的旷野。” And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 扫罗就从以色列人中挑选三千精兵，率领他们往野羊的磐石去，寻索大卫和跟随他的人。 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 到了路旁的羊圈，在那里有洞，扫罗进去大解。大卫和跟随他的人正藏在洞里的深处。 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 跟随的人对大卫说：“耶和华曾应许你说，我要将你的仇敌交在你手里，你可以任意待他。如今时候到了！”大卫就起来，悄悄地割下扫罗外袍的衣襟。 And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 随后大卫心中自责，因为割下扫罗的衣襟。 And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 对跟随他的人说：“我的主，乃是耶和华的受膏者，我在耶和华面前万不敢伸手害他，因他是耶和华的受膏者。” And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 大卫用这话拦住跟随他的人，不容他们起来害扫罗。扫罗起来，从洞里出去行路。 So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 随后大卫也起来，从洞里出去，呼叫扫罗说：“我主！我王！”扫罗回头观看，大卫就屈身脸伏于地下拜。 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 大卫对扫罗说：“你为何听信人的谗言说，大卫想要害你呢？ And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 今日你亲眼看见在洞中耶和华将你交在我手里；有人叫我杀你，我却爱惜你，说我不敢伸手害我的主，因为他是耶和华的受膏者。 Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD's anointed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 我父啊！看看你外袍的衣襟在我手中。我割下你的衣襟，没有杀你，你由此可以知道我没有恶意叛逆你。你虽然猎取我的命，我却没有得罪你。 Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 愿耶和华在你我中间判断是非，在你身上为我伸冤，我却不亲手加害于你。 The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 古人有句俗语说，恶事出于恶人。我却不亲手加害于你。 As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 以色列王出来要寻找谁呢？追赶谁呢？不过追赶一条死狗，一个虼蚤就是了。 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 愿耶和华在你我中间施行审判，断定是非，并且鉴察，为我伸冤，救我脱离你的手。” The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 大卫向扫罗说完这话，扫罗说：“我儿大卫！这是你的声音吗？”就放声大哭。 And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 对大卫说：“你比我公义，因为你以善待我，我却以恶待你！ And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 你今日显明是以善待我，因为耶和华将我交在你手里，你却没有杀我。 And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 人若遇见仇敌，岂肯放他平安无事地去呢？愿耶和华因你今日向我所行的，以善报你！ For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 我也知道你必要作王，以色列的国必坚立在你手里。 And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 现在你要指着耶和华向我起誓，不剪除我的后裔，在我父家不灭没我的名。” Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 于是大卫向扫罗起誓，扫罗就回家去。大卫和跟随他的人，上山寨去了。 And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_25">撒母耳记上 25</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 撒母耳死了。以色列众人聚集，为他哀哭，将他葬在拉玛，他自己的坟墓里(“坟墓”原文作“房屋”)。大卫起身，下到巴兰的旷野。 And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 在玛云有一个人，他的产业在迦密，是一个大富户，有三千绵羊，一千山羊。他正在迦密剪羊毛。 And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 那人名叫拿八，是迦勒族的人。他的妻名叫亚比该，是聪明俊美的妇人；拿八为人刚愎凶恶。 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 大卫在旷野听见说拿八剪羊毛， And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 大卫就打发十个仆人，吩咐他们说：“你们上迦密去见拿八，提我的名问他安。 And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 要对那富户如此说：‘愿你平安，愿你家平安，愿你一切所有的都平安。 And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 现在我听说有人为你剪羊毛，你的牧人在迦密的时候，和我们在一处，我们没有欺负他们，他们也未曾失落什么。 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 可以问你的仆人，他们必告诉你。所以愿我的仆人在你眼前蒙恩，因为是在好日子来的。求你随手取点赐与仆人，和你儿子大卫。’” Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 大卫的仆人到了，将这话提大卫的名都告诉了拿八，就住了口。 And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 拿八回答大卫的仆人说：“大卫是谁？耶西的儿子是谁？近来悖逆主人奔逃的仆人甚多。 And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 我岂可将饮食和为我剪羊毛人所宰的肉，给我不知道从哪里来的人呢？” Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 大卫的仆人就转身，从原路回去，照这话告诉大卫。 So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 大卫向跟随他的人说：“你们各人都要带上刀！”众人就都带上刀，大卫也带上刀。跟随大卫上去的约有四百人，留下二百人看守器具。 And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 有拿八的一个仆人告诉拿八的妻亚比该说：“大卫从旷野打发使者来问我主人的安，主人却辱骂他们。 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 但是那些人待我们甚好；我们在田野与他们来往的时候，没有受他们的欺负，也未曾失落什么。 But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 我们在他们那里牧羊的时候，他们昼夜作我们的保障。 They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 所以你当筹划，看怎样行才好；不然，祸患定要临到我主人和他全家。他性情凶暴，无人敢与他说话。” Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 亚比该急忙将二百饼、两皮袋酒、五只收拾好了的羊、五细亚烘好了的穗子、一百葡萄饼、二百无花果饼、都驮在驴上。 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 对仆人说：“你们前头走，我随着你们去。”这事她却没有告诉丈夫拿八。 And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 亚比该骑着驴，正下山坡，见大卫和跟随他的人从对面下来，亚比该就迎接他们。 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 大卫曾说：“我在旷野为那人看守所有的，以致他一样不失落，实在是徒然了，他向我以恶报善。 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 凡属拿八的男丁，我若留一个到明日早晨，愿　神重重降罚与我。” So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 亚比该见大卫，便急忙下驴，在大卫面前脸伏于地叩拜， And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 俯伏在大卫的脚前，说：“我主啊！愿这罪归我！求你容婢女向你进言，更求你听婢女的话。 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 我主不要理这坏人拿八，他的性情与他的名相称；他名叫拿八(就是“愚顽”的意思)，他为人果然愚顽。但我主所打发的仆人，婢女并没有看见。 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 我主啊！耶和华既然阻止你亲手报仇，取流血的罪，所以我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，说：愿你的仇敌和谋害你的人，都象拿八一样。 Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 如今求你将婢女送来的礼物，给跟随你的仆人。 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 求你饶恕婢女的罪过。耶和华必为我主建立坚固的家，因我主为耶和华争战；并且在你平生的日子，查不出有什么过来。 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 虽有人起来追逼你，寻索你的性命，你的性命却在耶和华你的　神那里蒙保护，如包裹宝器一样；你仇敌的性命，耶和华必抛去，如用机弦甩石一样。 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: - And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 我主现在若不亲手报仇，流无辜人的血，到了耶和华照所应许你的话赐福与你，立你作以色列的王，那时我主必不至心里不安，觉得良心有亏。耶和华赐福与我主的时候，求你记念婢女。” That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 大卫对亚比该说：“耶和华以色列的　神，是应当称颂的，因为他今日使你来迎接我。 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 你和你的见识也当称赞，因为你今日拦阻我亲手报仇，流人的血。 And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 我指着阻止我加害于你的耶和华以色列永生的　神起誓，你若不速速地来迎接我，到明日早晨，凡属拿八的男丁，必定不留一个。” For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 大卫受了亚比该送来的礼物，就对她说：“我听了你的话，准了你的情面，你可以平平安安地回家吧！” So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 亚比该到拿八那里，见他在家里设摆筵席，如同王的筵席。拿八快乐大醉，亚比该无论大小事，都没有告诉他，就等到次日早晨。 And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 到了早晨，拿八醒了酒，他的妻将这些事都告诉他，他就魂不附体，身僵如石头一般。 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 过了十天，耶和华击打拿八，他就死了。 And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 大卫听见拿八死了，就说：“应当称颂耶和华，因他伸了拿八羞辱我的冤，又阻止仆人行恶；也使拿八的恶归到拿八的头上。”于是大卫打发人去，与亚比该说，要娶她为妻。 And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 大卫的仆人到了迦密见亚比该，对她说：“大卫打发我们来见你，想要娶你为妻。” And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 亚比该就起来，俯伏在地，说：“我情愿作婢女，洗我主仆人的脚。” And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 亚比该立刻起身，骑上驴，带着五个使女，跟从大卫的使者去了，就作了大卫的妻。 And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 大卫先娶了耶斯列人亚希暖，她们二人都作了他的妻。 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 扫罗已将他的女儿米甲，就是大卫的妻，给了迦琳人拉亿的儿子帕提为妻。 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_26">撒母耳记上 26</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 西弗人到基比亚见扫罗，说：“大卫不是在旷野前的哈基拉山藏着吗？” And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 扫罗就起身，带领以色列人中挑选的三千精兵，下到西弗的旷野，要在那里寻索大卫。 Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 扫罗在旷野前的哈基拉山，在道路上安营。大卫住在旷野，听说扫罗到旷野来追寻他， And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 就打发人去探听，便知道扫罗果然来到。 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 大卫起来，到扫罗安营的地方，看见扫罗和他的元帅尼珥的儿子押尼珥睡卧之处；扫罗睡在辎重营里，百姓安营在他周围。 And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 大卫对赫人亚希米勒和洗鲁雅的儿子约押的兄弟亚比筛说：“谁同我下到扫罗营里去？”亚比筛说：“我同你下去。” Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 于是大卫和亚比筛夜间到了百姓那里，见扫罗睡在辎重营里，他的枪在头旁，插在地上。押尼珥和百姓睡在他周围。 So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 亚比筛对大卫说：“现在　神将你的仇敌交在你手里，求你容我拿枪将他刺透在地；一刺就成，不用再刺。” Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 大卫对亚比筛说：“不可害死他！有谁伸手害耶和华的受膏者而无罪呢？” And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 大卫又说：“我指着永生的耶和华起誓，他或被耶和华击打，或是死期到了，或是出战阵亡。 David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 我在耶和华面前，万不敢伸手害耶和华的受膏者。现在你可以将他头旁的枪和水瓶拿来，我们就走！” The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 大卫从扫罗的头旁，拿了枪和水瓶，二人就走了。没有人看见，没有人知道，也没有人醒起，都睡着了。因为耶和华使他们沉沉地睡了。 So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 大卫过到那边去，远远地站在山顶上，与他们相离甚远。 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 大卫呼叫百姓和尼珥的儿子押尼珥，说：“押尼珥啊！你为何不答应呢？”押尼珥说：“你是谁？竟敢呼叫王呢？” And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 大卫对押尼珥说：“你不是个勇士吗？以色列中谁能比你呢？民中有人进来要害死王你的主，你为何没有保护王你的主呢？ And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 你这样是不好的！我指着永生的耶和华起誓，你们都是该死的，因为没有保护你们的主，就是耶和华的受膏者。现在你看看王头旁的枪和水瓶在哪里？” This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 扫罗听出是大卫的声音，就说：“我儿大卫！这是你的声音吗？”大卫说：“主我的王啊！是我的声音。” And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 又说：“我作了什么？我手里有什么恶事？我主竟追赶仆人呢？ And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 求我主我王听仆人的话：若是耶和华激发你攻击我，愿耶和华收纳祭物；若是人激发你，愿他在耶和华面前受咒诅。因为他现今赶逐我，不容我在耶和华的产业上有分，说：‘你去事奉别神吧！’ Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 现在求王不要使我的血流在离耶和华远的地方。以色列王出来，是寻找一个虼蚤，如同人在山上猎取一个鹧鸪一般。” Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 扫罗说：“我有罪了！我儿大卫，你可以回来，因你今日看我的性命为宝贵，我必不再加害于你。我是糊涂人，大大错了。” Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 大卫说：“王的枪在这里，可以吩咐一个仆人过来拿去。 And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 今日耶和华将王交在我手里，我却不肯伸手害耶和华的受膏者。耶和华必照各人的公义诚实报应他。 The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 我今日重看你的性命，愿耶和华也重看我的性命，并且拯救我脱离一切患难。” And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 扫罗对大卫说：“我儿大卫，愿你得福！你必作大事，也必得胜。”于是大卫起行，扫罗回他的本处去了。 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_27">撒母耳记上 27</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 大卫心里说，必有一日我死在扫罗手里，不如逃奔非利士地去。扫罗见我不在以色列的境内，就必绝望，不再寻索我，这样我可以脱离他的手。 And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 于是大卫起身，和跟随他的六百人，投奔迦特王玛俄的儿子亚吉去了。 And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 大卫和他的两个妻，就是耶斯列人亚希暖和作过拿八妻的迦密人亚比该，并跟随他的人，连各人的眷属，都住在迦特亚吉那里。 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 有人告诉扫罗说：“大卫逃到迦特。”扫罗就不再寻索他了。 And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 大卫对亚吉说：“我若在你眼前蒙恩，求你在京外的城邑中，赐我一个地方居住。仆人何必与王同住京都呢？” And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 当日亚吉将洗革拉赐给他，因此洗革拉属犹大王，直到今日。 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 大卫在非利士地住了一年零四个月。 And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 大卫和跟随他的人上去，侵夺基述人、基色人、亚玛力人之地。这几族历来住在那地，从书珥直到埃及。 And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 大卫击杀那地的人，无论男女都没有留下一个；又夺获牛、羊、骆驼、驴，并衣服，回来见亚吉。 And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 亚吉说：“你们今日侵夺了什么地方呢？”大卫说：“侵夺了犹大的南方，耶拉篾的南方，基尼的南方。” And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 无论男女，大卫没有留下一个带到迦特来。他说：“恐怕他们将我们的事告诉人说：大卫住在非利士地的时候，常常这样行。” And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 亚吉信了大卫，心里说：“大卫使本族以色列人憎恶他，所以他必永远作我的仆人了。” And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_28">撒母耳记上 28</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 那时，非利士人聚集军旅，要与以色列人打仗。亚吉对大卫说：“你当知道，你和跟随你的人，都要随我出战。” And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 大卫对亚吉说：“仆人所能作的事，王必知道。”亚吉对大卫说：“这样，我立你永远作我的护卫长。” And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 那时撒母耳已经死了，以色列众人为他哀哭，葬他在拉玛，就是在他本城里。扫罗曾在国内不容有交鬼的和行巫术的人。 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 非利士人聚集，来到书念安营；扫罗聚集以色列众人，在基利波安营。 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 扫罗看见非利士的军旅，就惧怕，心中发颤。 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 扫罗求问耶和华，耶和华却不借梦，或乌陵，或先知回答他。 And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 扫罗吩咐臣仆说：“当为我找一个交鬼的妇人，我好去问她。”臣仆说：“在隐多珥有一个交鬼的妇人。” Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 于是扫罗改了装，穿上别的衣服，带着两个人，夜里去见那妇人。扫罗说：“求你用交鬼的法术，将我所告诉你的死人，为我招上来。” And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 妇人对他说：“你知道扫罗从国中剪除交鬼的和行巫术的。你为何陷害我的性命，使我死呢？” And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 扫罗向妇人指着耶和华起誓说：“我指着永生的耶和华起誓，你必不因这事受刑。” And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 妇人说：“我为你招谁上来呢？”回答说：“为我招撒母耳上来。” Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 妇人看见撒母耳，就大声呼叫，对扫罗说：“你是扫罗，为什么欺哄我呢？” And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 王对妇人说：“不要惧怕！你看见了什么呢？”妇人对扫罗说：“我看见有神从地里上来。” And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 扫罗说：“他是怎样的形状？”妇人说：“有一个老人上来，身穿长衣。”扫罗知道是撒母耳，就屈身，脸伏于地下拜。 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 撒母耳对扫罗说：“你为什么搅扰我，招我上来呢？”扫罗回答说：“我甚窘急，因为非利士人攻击我，　神也离开我，不再借先知或梦回答我。因此请你上来，好指示我应当怎样行。” And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 撒母耳说：“耶和华已经离开你，且与你为敌，你何必问我呢？ Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 耶和华照他借我说的话，已经从你手里夺去国权，赐与别人，就是大卫。 And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 因你没有听从耶和华的命令，他恼怒亚玛力人，你没有灭绝他们，所以今日耶和华向你这样行； Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 并且耶和华必将你和以色列人交在非利士人的手里，明日你和你众子必与我在一处了；耶和华必将以色列的军兵交在非利士人手里。” Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 扫罗猛然仆倒，挺身在地，因撒母耳的话，甚是惧怕。那一昼一夜，没有吃什么，就毫无气力。 Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 妇人到扫罗面前，见他极其惊恐，对他说：“婢女听从你的话，不顾惜自己的性命，遵从你所吩咐的。 And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 现在求你听婢女的话，容我在你面前摆上一点食物；你吃了，可以有气力行路。” Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 扫罗不肯，说：“我不吃。”但他的仆人和妇人，再三劝他，他才听了他们的话，从地上起来，坐在床上。 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 妇人急忙将家里的一只肥牛犊宰了，又拿面抟成无酵饼，烤了， And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 摆在扫罗和他仆人面前；他们吃完，当夜就起身走了。 And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor9_29">撒母耳记上 29</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 非利士人将他们的军旅聚到亚弗；以色列人在耶斯列的泉旁安营。 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 非利士人的首领，各率军队，或百或千，挨次前进。大卫和跟随他的人，同着亚吉，跟在后边。 And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 非利士人的首领说：“这些希伯来人在这里作什么呢？”亚吉对他们说：“这不是以色列王扫罗的臣子大卫吗？他在我这里有些年日了。自从他投降我，直到今日，我未曾见他有过错。” Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here?
