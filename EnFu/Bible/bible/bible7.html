So Simeon went with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 犹大就上去。耶和华将迦南人和比利洗人交在他们手中，他们在比色击杀了一万人。 And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 又在那里遇见亚多尼比色，与他争战，杀败迦南人和比利洗人。 And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 亚多尼比色逃跑，他们追赶，拿住他，砍断他手脚的大拇指。 But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 亚多尼比色说：“从前有七十个王，手脚的大拇指都被我砍断，在我桌子底下拾取零碎食物。现在　神按着我所行的报应我了。”于是他们将亚多尼比色带到耶路撒冷，他就死在那里。 And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 犹大人攻打耶路撒冷，将城攻取，用刀杀了城内的人，并且放火烧城。 Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 后来犹大人下去，与住山地南地和高原的迦南人争战。 And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 犹大人去攻击住希伯仑的迦南人，杀了示筛、亚希幔、挞买。希伯仑从前名叫基列亚巴。 And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 他们从那里去攻击底璧的居民。底璧从前名叫基列西弗。 And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 迦勒说：“谁能攻打基列西弗，将城夺取，我就把我女儿押撒给他为妻。” And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 迦勒兄弟基纳斯的儿子俄陀聂，夺取了那城，迦勒就把女儿押撒给他为妻。 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 押撒过门的时候，劝丈夫向她父亲求一块田。押撒一下驴，迦勒问她说：“你要什么？” And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 她说：“求你赐福给我：你既将我安置在南地，求你也给我水泉。”迦勒就把上泉下泉赐给她。 And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 摩西的内兄(或作“岳父”)是基尼人，他的子孙与犹大人一同离了棕树城，往亚拉得以南的犹大旷野去，就住在民中。 And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 犹大和他哥哥西缅同去，击杀了住洗法的迦南人，将城尽行毁灭，那城的名便叫何珥玛。 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 犹大又取了迦萨和迦萨的四境，亚实基伦和亚实基伦的四境，以革伦和以革伦的四境。 Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 耶和华与犹大同在，犹大就赶出山地的居民，只是不能赶出平原的居民，因为他们有铁车。 And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 以色列人照摩西所说的，将希伯仑给了迦勒；迦勒就从那里赶出亚衲族的三个族长。 And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 便雅悯人没有赶出住耶路撒冷的耶布斯人。耶布斯人仍在耶路撒冷与便雅悯人同住，直到今日。 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 约瑟家也上去攻打伯特利，耶和华与他们同在。 And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD was with them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 约瑟家打发人去窥探伯特利。那城起先名叫路斯。 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 窥探的人看见一个人从城里出来，就对他说：“求你将进城的路指示我们，我们必恩待你。” And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 那人将进城的路指示他们，他们就用刀击杀了城中的居民，但将那人和他全家放去。 And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 那人往赫人之地去，筑了一座城，起名叫路斯。那城到如今还叫这名。 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 玛拿西没有赶出伯善和属伯善乡村的居民，他纳和属他纳乡村的居民，多珥和属多珥乡村的居民，以伯莲和属以伯莲乡村的居民，米吉多和属米吉多乡村的居民；迦南人却执意住在那些地方。 Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 及至以色列强盛了，就使迦南人作苦工，没有把他们全然赶出。 And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 以法莲没有赶出住基色的迦南人。于是迦南人仍住在基色，在以法莲中间。 Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 西布伦没有赶出基伦的居民和拿哈拉的居民。于是迦南人仍住在西布伦中间，成了服苦的人。 Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 亚设没有赶出亚柯和西顿的居民，亚黑拉和亚革悉的居民，黑巴、亚弗革与利合的居民。 Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 于是，亚设因为没有赶出那地的迦南人，就住在他们中间。 But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 拿弗他利没有赶出伯示麦和伯亚纳的居民。于是拿弗他利就住在那地的迦南人中间；然而伯示麦和伯亚纳的居民成了服苦的人。 Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 亚摩利人强逼但人住在山地，不容他们下到平原； And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 亚摩利人却执意住在希烈山和亚雅伦并沙宾。然而约瑟家胜了他们，使他们成了服苦的人。 But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 亚摩利人的境界，是从亚克拉滨坡，从西拉而上。 And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor7_2">士师记 2</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶和华的使者从吉甲上到波金，对以色列人说：“我使你们从埃及上来，领你们到我向你们列祖起誓应许之地。我又说：‘我永不废弃与你们所立的约。 And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 你们也不可与这地的居民立约，要拆毁他们的祭坛。你们竟没有听从我的话！为何这样行呢？’ And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 因此我又说：‘我必不将他们从你们面前赶出；他们必作你们肋下的荆棘。他们的神，必作你们的网罗。’” Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 耶和华的使者向以色列众人说这话的时候，百姓就放声而哭。 And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 于是给那地方起名叫波金(就是“哭”的意思)，众人在那里向耶和华献祭。 And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 从前约书亚打发以色列百姓去的时候，他们各归自己的地业，占据地土。 And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 约书亚在世和约书亚死后，那些见耶和华为以色列人所行大事的长老还在的时候，百姓都事奉耶和华。 And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 耶和华的仆人，嫩的儿子约书亚，正一百一十岁就死了。 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 以色列人将他葬在他地业的境内，就是在以法莲山地的亭拿希烈，在迦实山的北边。 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 那世代的人，也都归了自己的列祖。后来有别的世代兴起，不知道耶和华，也不知道耶和华为以色列人所行的事。 And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 以色列人行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，去事奉诸巴力， And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 离弃了领他们出埃及地的耶和华，他们列祖的　神，去叩拜别神，就是四围列国的神，惹耶和华发怒。 And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 并离弃耶和华，去事奉巴力和亚斯他录。 And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 耶和华的怒气向以色列人发作，就把他们交在抢夺他们的人手中。又将他们付与四围仇敌的手中，甚至他们在仇敌面前再不能站立得住。 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 他们无论往何处去，耶和华都以灾祸攻击他们，正如耶和华所说的话，又如耶和华向他们所起的誓。他们便极其困苦。 Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 耶和华兴起士师，士师就拯救他们脱离抢夺他们人的手。 Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 他们却不听从士师，竟随从叩拜别神，行了邪淫，速速地偏离他们列祖所行的道，不如他们列祖顺从耶和华的命令。 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 耶和华为他们兴起士师，就与那士师同在。士师在世的一切日子，耶和华拯救他们脱离仇敌的手。他们因受欺压扰害，就哀声叹气，所以耶和华后悔了。 And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 及至士师死后，他们就转去行恶，比他们列祖更甚，去事奉叩拜别神，总不断绝顽梗的恶行。 And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 于是耶和华的怒气向以色列人发作。他说：“因这民违背我吩咐他们列祖所守的约，不听从我的话。 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 所以约书亚死的时候所剩下的各族，我必不再从他们面前赶出， I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 为要借此试验以色列人，看他们肯照他们列祖谨守遵行我的道不肯。” That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 这样耶和华留下各族，不将他们速速赶出，也没有交付约书亚的手。 Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor7_3">士师记 3</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶和华留下这几族，为要试验那不曾知道与迦南争战之事的以色列人， Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 好叫以色列的后代，又知道又学习未曾晓得的战事。 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 所留下的，就是非利士的五个首领，和一切迦南人、西顿人，并住黎巴嫩山的希未人，从巴力黑们山直到哈马口。 Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 留下这几族，为要试验以色列人，知道他们肯听从耶和华借摩西吩咐他们列祖的诫命不肯。 And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 以色列人竟住在迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人中间， And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 娶他们的女儿为妻，将自己的女儿嫁给他们的儿子，并事奉他们的神。 And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 以色列人行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，忘记耶和华他们的　神，去事奉诸巴力和亚舍拉。 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 所以，耶和华的怒气向以色列人发作，就把他们交在美索不达米亚王古珊利萨田的手中。以色列人服事古珊利萨田八年。 Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 以色列人呼求耶和华的时候，耶和华就为他们兴起一位拯救者救他们，就是迦勒兄弟基纳斯的儿子俄陀聂。 And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 耶和华的灵降在他身上，他就作了以色列的士师，出去争战。耶和华将美索不达米亚王古珊利萨田交在他手中，他便胜了古珊利萨田。 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 于是国中太平四十年。基纳斯的儿子俄陀聂死了。 And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 以色列人又行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，耶和华就使摩押王伊矶伦强盛，攻击以色列人。 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 伊矶伦招聚亚扪人和亚玛力人，去攻打以色列人，占据棕树城。 And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 于是以色列人服事摩押王伊矶伦十八年。 So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 以色列人呼求耶和华的时候，耶和华就为他们兴起一位拯救者，就是便雅悯人基拉的儿子以笏；他是左手便利的。以色列人托他送礼物给摩押王伊矶伦。 But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 以笏打了一把两刃的剑，长一肘，带在右腿上衣服里面。 But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 他将礼物献给摩押王伊矶伦，原来伊矶伦极其肥胖。 And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 以笏献完礼物，便将抬礼物的人打发走了。 And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 自己却从靠近吉甲凿石之地回来，说：“王啊！我有一件机密事奏告你。”王说：“回避吧！”于是左右侍立的人都退去了。 But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 以笏来到王面前；王独自一人坐在凉楼上。以笏说：“我奉　神的命报告你一件事。”王就从座位上站起来。 And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 以笏便伸左手，从右腿上拔出剑来，刺入王的肚腹， And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 连剑把都刺进去了。剑被肥肉夹住，他没有从王的肚腹拔出来，且穿通了后身。 And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 以笏就出到游廊，将楼门尽都关锁。 Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 以笏出来之后，王的仆人到了，看见楼门关锁，就说：“他必是在楼上大解。” When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 他们等烦了，见仍不开楼门，就拿钥匙开了。不料！他们的主人已死，倒在地上。 And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 他们耽延的时候，以笏就逃跑了，经过凿石之地，逃到西伊拉。 And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 到了，就在以法莲山地吹角。以色列人随着他下了山地，他在前头引路， And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 对他们说：“你们随我来，因为耶和华已经把你们的仇敌摩押人交在你们手中。”于是他们跟着他下去，把守约但河的渡口，不容摩押一人过去。 And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 那时击杀了摩押人约有一万，都是强壮的勇士，没有一人逃脱。 And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 这样，摩押就被以色列人制伏了。国中太平八十年。 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel.

And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 巴拉就招聚西布伦人和拿弗他利人到基低斯，跟他上去的有一万人。底波拉也同他上去。 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 摩西岳父(或作“内兄”)何巴的后裔基尼人希百，曾离开基尼族，到靠近基低斯撒拿音的橡树旁，支搭帐棚。 Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 有人告诉西西拉说：“亚比挪庵的儿子巴拉已经上他泊山了。” And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 西西拉就聚集所有的铁车九百辆和跟随他的全军，从外邦人的夏罗设出来，到了基顺河。 And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 底波拉对巴拉说：“你起来，今日就是耶和华将西西拉交在你手的日子。耶和华岂不在你前头行吗？”于是巴拉下了他泊山，跟随他有一万人。 And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 耶和华使西西拉和他一切车辆全军溃乱，在巴拉面前被刀杀败，西西拉下车步行逃跑。 And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 巴拉追赶车辆、军队，直到外邦人的夏罗设。西西拉的全军，都倒在刀下，没有留下一人。 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 只有西西拉步行逃跑，到了基尼人希百之妻雅亿的帐棚；因为夏琐王耶宾与基尼人希百家和好。 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 雅亿出来迎接西西拉，对他说：“请我主进来，不要惧怕。”西西拉就进了她的帐棚，雅亿用被将他遮盖。 And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 西西拉对雅亿说：“我渴了，求你给我一点水喝。”雅亿就打开皮袋，给他奶子喝，仍旧把他遮盖。 And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.

Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 　神已将米甸人的两个首领俄立和西伊伯，交在你们手中；我所行的，岂能比你们所行的呢？”基甸说了这话，以法莲人的怒气就消了。 God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 基甸和跟随他的三百人，到约但河过渡，虽然疲乏，还是追赶。 And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 基甸对疏割人说：“求你们拿饼来给跟随我的人吃，因为他们疲乏了；我们追赶米甸人的两个王西巴和撒慕拿。” And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 疏割人的首领回答说：“西巴和撒慕拿已经在你手里，你使我们将饼给你的军兵吗？” And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 基甸说：“耶和华将西巴和撒慕拿交在我手之后，我就用野地的荆条和枳棘打伤你们。” And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 基甸从那里上到毗努伊勒，对那里的人也是这样说；毗努伊勒人也与疏割人回答他的话一样。 And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他向毗努伊勒人说：“我平平安安回来的时候，我必拆毁这楼。” And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 那时，西巴和撒慕拿并跟随他们的军队，都在加各，约有一万五千人，就是东方人全军所剩下的；已经被杀约有十二万拿刀的。 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 基甸就由挪巴和约比哈东边，从住帐棚人的路上去，杀败了米甸人的军兵，因为他们坦然无惧。 And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 西巴和撒慕拿逃跑；基甸追赶他们，捉住米甸的二王西巴和撒慕拿，惊散全军。 And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 约阿施的儿子基甸，由希列斯坡从阵上回来， And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 捉住疏割的一个少年人，问他：“疏割的首领、长老是谁？”他就将首领、长老七十七个人的名字写出来。 And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 基甸到了疏割，对那里的人说：“你们从前讥诮我说：‘西巴和撒慕拿已经在你手里，你使我们将饼给跟随你的疲乏人吗？’现在西巴和撒慕拿在这里。” And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 于是捉住那城内的长老，用野地的荆条和枳棘责打(原文作“指教”)疏割人。 And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 又拆了毗努伊勒的楼，杀了那城里的人。 And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 基甸问西巴和撒慕拿说：“你们在他泊山所杀的人是什么样式？”回答说：“他们好象你，各人都有王子的样式。” Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 基甸说：“他们是我同母的弟兄。我指着永生的耶和华起誓，你们从前若存留他们的性命，我如今就不杀你们了。” And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 于是对他的长子益帖说：“你起来杀他们！”但益帖因为是童子，害怕，不敢拔刀。 And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 西巴和撒慕拿说：“你自己起来杀我们吧！因为人如何，力量也是如何。”基甸就起来，杀了西巴和撒慕拿，夺获他们骆驼项上戴的月牙圈。 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 以色列人对基甸说：“你既救我们脱离米甸人的手，愿你和你的儿孙管理我们。” Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 基甸说：“我不管理你们，我的儿子也不管理你们，惟有耶和华管理你们。” And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 基甸又对他们说：“我有一件事求你们：请你们各人将所夺的耳环给我。”(原来仇敌是以实玛利人，都是戴金耳环的。) And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 他们说：“我们情愿给你。”就铺开一件外衣，各人将所夺的耳环丢在其上。 And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 基甸所要出来的金耳环，重一千七百舍客勒金子。此外还有米甸王所戴的月环、耳坠，和所穿的紫色衣服，并骆驼项上的金链子。 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 基甸以此制造了一个以弗得，设立在本城俄弗拉。后来以色列人拜那以弗得行了邪淫。这就作了基甸和他全家的网罗。 And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 这样，米甸人被以色列人制伏了，不敢再抬头。基甸还在的日子，国中太平四十年。 Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 约阿施的儿子耶路巴力回去，住在自己家里。 And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 基甸有七十个亲生的儿子，因为他有许多的妻。 And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 他的妾住在示剑，也给他生了一个儿子。基甸与他起名叫亚比米勒。 And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 约阿施的儿子基甸，年纪老迈而死，葬在亚比以谢族的俄弗拉，在他父亲约阿施的坟墓里。 And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 基甸死后，以色列人又去随从诸巴力行邪淫，以巴力比利土为他们的神。 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 以色列人不记念耶和华他们的　神，就是拯救他们脱离四围仇敌之手的。 And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 也不照着耶路巴力，就是基甸，向他们所施的恩惠，厚待他的家。 Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor7_9">士师记 9</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶路巴力的儿子亚比米勒，到了示剑见他的众母舅，对他们和他外祖全家的人说： And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: “请你们问示剑的众人说，是耶路巴力的众子七十人都管理你们好呢？还是一人管理你们好呢？你们又要记念我是你们的骨肉。” Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 他的众母舅便将这一切话，为他说给示剑人听，示剑人的心，就归向亚比米勒；他们说：“他原是我们的弟兄。” And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 就从巴力比利土的庙中，取了七十舍客勒银子给亚比米勒；亚比米勒用以雇了些匪徒跟随他。 And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他往俄弗拉到他父亲的家，将他弟兄耶路巴力的众子七十人，都杀在一块磐石上；只剩下耶路巴力的小儿子约坦，因为他躲藏了。 And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 示剑人和米罗人，都一同聚集，往示剑橡树旁的柱子那里，立亚比米勒为王。 And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 有人将这事告诉约坦，他就去站在基利心山顶上，向众人大声喊叫说：“示剑人哪！你们要听我的话，　神也就听你们的话。 And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 有一时，树木要膏一树为王，管理他们，就去对橄榄树说：‘请你作我们的王。’ The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 橄榄树回答说：‘我岂肯止住供奉　神和尊重人的油，飘摇在众树之上呢？’ But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 树木对无花果树说：‘请你来作我们的王。’ And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 无花果树回答说：‘我岂肯止住所结甜美的果子，飘摇在众树之上呢？’ But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 树木对葡萄树说：‘请你来作我们的王。’ Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 葡萄树回答说：‘我岂肯止住使　神和人喜乐的新酒，飘摇在众树之上呢？’ And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 众树对荆棘说：‘请你来作我们的王。’ Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 荆棘回答说：‘你们若诚诚实实地膏我为王，就要投在我的荫下；不然，愿火从荆棘里出来，烧灭黎巴嫩的香柏树。’ And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: “现在你们立亚比米勒为王，若按诚实正直善待耶路巴力和他的全家，这就是酬他的劳。 Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 从前我父冒死，为你们争战，救了你们脱离米甸人的手。 (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 你们如今起来攻击我的父家，将他众子七十人杀在一块磐石上，又立他婢女所生的儿子亚比米勒为示剑人的王；他原是你们的弟兄。 And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 你们如今若按诚实正直待耶路巴力和他的家，就可因亚比米勒得欢乐，他也可因你们得欢乐。 If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 不然，愿火从亚比米勒发出，烧灭示剑人和米罗众人；又愿火从示剑人和米罗人中出来，烧灭亚比米勒。” But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 约坦因怕他弟兄亚比米勒，就逃跑，来到比珥住在那里。 And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 亚比米勒管理以色列人三年。 When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 　神使恶魔降在亚比米勒和示剑人中间，示剑人就以诡诈待亚比米勒。 Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 这是要叫耶路巴力七十个儿子所受的残害，归与他们的哥哥亚比米勒。又叫那流他们血的罪，归与帮助他杀弟兄的示剑人。 That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 示剑人在山顶上设埋伏，等候亚比米勒。凡从他们那里经过的人，他们就抢夺。有人将这事告诉亚比米勒。 And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 以别的儿子迦勒和他的弟兄来到示剑，示剑人都信靠他。 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 示剑人出城到田间去，摘下葡萄，踹酒，设摆筵宴，进他们神的庙中吃喝，咒诅亚比米勒。 And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 以别的儿子迦勒说：“亚比米勒是谁？示剑是谁？使我们服事他呢？他不是耶路巴力的儿子吗？他的帮手不是西布勒吗？你们可以服事示剑的父亲哈抹的后裔。我们为何服事亚比米勒呢？ And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 玛挪亚对他的妻说：“我们必要死，因为看见了　神。” And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 他的妻却对他说：“耶和华若要杀我们，必不从我们手里收纳燔祭和素祭，并不将这一切事指示我们，今日也不将这些话告诉我们。” But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 后来妇人生了一个儿子，给他起名叫参孙。孩子长大，耶和华赐福与他。 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 在玛哈尼但，就是琐拉和以实陶中间，耶和华的灵才感动他。 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor7_14">士师记 14</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 参孙下到亭拿，在那里看见一个女子，是非利士人的女儿。 And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 参孙上来禀告他父母说：“我在亭拿看见一个女子，是非利士人的女儿，愿你们给我娶来为妻。” And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 他父母说：“在你弟兄的女儿中，或在本国的民中，岂没有一个女子，何至你去在未受割礼的非利士人中娶妻呢？”参孙对他父亲说：“愿你给我娶那女子，因我喜悦她。” Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他的父母却不知道这事是出于耶和华，因为他找机会攻击非利士人。那时，非利士人辖制以色列人。 But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 参孙跟他父母下亭拿去。到了亭拿的葡萄园，见有一只少壮狮子向他吼叫。 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 耶和华的灵大大感动参孙，他虽然手无器械，却将狮子撕裂，如同撕裂山羊羔一样。他行这事并没有告诉父母。 And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 参孙下去与女子说话，就喜悦她。 And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 过了些日子，再下去要娶那女子；转向道旁要看死狮，见有一群蜂子和蜜在死狮之内， And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 就用手取蜜，且吃且走；到了父母那里，给他父母，他们也吃了，只是没有告诉这蜜是从死狮之内取来的。 And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 他父亲下去见女子。参孙在那里设摆筵宴，因为向来少年人都有这个规矩。 So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 众人看见参孙，就请了三十个人陪伴他。 And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 参孙对他们说：“我给你们出一个谜语，你们在七日筵宴之内，若能猜出意思告诉我，我就给你们三十件里衣，三十套衣裳； And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 你们若不能猜出意思告诉我，你们就给我三十件里衣，三十套衣裳。”他们说：“请将谜语说给我们听。” But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 参孙对他们说：“吃的从吃者出来，甜的从强者出来。”他们三日不能猜出谜语的意思。 And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 到第七天，他们对参孙的妻说：“你诓哄你丈夫，探出谜语的意思告诉我们，免得我们用火烧你和你父家。你们请了我们来，是要夺我们所有的吗？” And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 参孙的妻在丈夫面前啼哭说：“你是恨我，不是爱我，你给我本国的人出谜语，却没有将意思告诉我。”参孙回答说：“连我父母我都没有告诉，岂可告诉你呢？” And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 七日筵宴之内，她在丈夫面前啼哭，到第七天逼着他，他才将谜语的意思告诉他妻，他妻就告诉本国的人。 And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 到第七天，日头未落以前，那城里的人对参孙说：“有什么比蜜还甜呢？有什么比狮子还强呢？”参孙对他们说：“你们若非用我的母牛犊耕地，就猜不出我谜语的意思来。” And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 耶和华的灵大大感动参孙，他就下到亚实基伦击杀了三十个人，夺了他们的衣裳，将衣裳给了猜出谜语的人。参孙发怒，就上父家去了。 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 参孙的妻便归了参孙的陪伴，就是作过他朋友的。 But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor7_15">士师记 15</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 过了些日子，到割麦子的时候，参孙带着一只山羊羔去看他的妻，说：“我要进内室见我的妻。”他岳父不容他进去， But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 说：“我估定你是极其恨她，因此我将她给了你的陪伴。她的妹子不是比她还美丽吗？你可以娶来代替她吧！” And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 参孙说：“这回我加害于非利士人不算有罪！” And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 于是参孙去捉了三百只狐狸(或作“野狗”)，将狐狸尾巴一对一对地捆上，将火把捆在两条尾巴中间， And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 点着火把，就放狐狸进入非利士人站着的禾稼，将堆集的禾捆和未割的禾稼，并橄榄园尽都烧了。 And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 非利士人说：“这事是谁作的呢？”有人说：“是亭拿人的女婿参孙，因为他岳父将他的妻给了他的陪伴。”于是非利士人上去，用火烧了妇人和她的父亲。 Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 参孙对非利士人说：“你们既然这样行，我必向你们报仇才肯罢休！” And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 参孙就大大击杀他们，连腿带腰都砍断了。他便下去，住在以坦磐的穴内。 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 非利士人上去安营在犹大，布散在利希。 Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 犹大人说：“你们为何上来攻击我们呢？”他们说：“我们上来是要捆绑参孙，他向我们怎样行，我们也要向他怎样行！”。 And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 于是有三千犹大人下到以坦磐的穴内，对参孙说：“非利士人辖制我们，你不知道吗？你向我们行的是什么事呢？”他回答说：“他们向我怎样行，我也要向他们怎样行！” Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 犹大人对他说：“我们下来是要捆绑你，将你交在非利士人手中。”参孙说：“你们要向我起誓，应承你们自己不害死我。” And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他们说：“我们断不杀你，只要将你捆绑交在非利士人手中。”于是用两条新绳捆绑参孙，将他从以坦磐带上去。 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 参孙到了利希，非利士人都迎着喧嚷。耶和华的灵大大感动参孙，他臂上的绳就象火烧的麻一样，他的绑绳都从他手上脱落下来。 And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 他见一块未干的驴腮骨，就伸手拾起来，用以击杀一千人。 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 参孙说：“我用驴腮骨杀人成堆，用驴腮骨杀了一千人。” And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 说完这话，就把那腮骨从手里抛出去了。那地便叫拉末利希。 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 参孙甚觉口渴，就求告耶和华说：“你既借仆人的手施行这么大的拯救，岂可任我渴死，落在未受割礼的人手中呢？” And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 　神就使利希的洼处裂开，有水从其中涌出来。参孙喝了精神复原；因此那泉名叫隐哈歌利，那泉直到今日还在利希。 But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 当非利士人辖制以色列人的时候，参孙作以色列的士师二十年。 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor7_16">士师记 16</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 参孙到了迦萨，在那里看见一个妓女，就与她亲近。 Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 有人告诉迦萨人说：“参孙到这里来了！”他们就把他团团围住，终夜在城门悄悄埋伏，说：“等到天亮我们便杀他。” And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 参孙睡到半夜，起来，将城门的门扇、门框、门闩，一齐拆下来，扛在肩上，扛到希伯仑前的山顶上。 And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 后来参孙在梭烈谷喜爱一个妇人，名叫大利拉。 And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 非利士人的首领上去见那妇人，对她说：“求你诓哄参孙，探探他因何有这么大的力气，我们用何法能胜他，捆绑克制他。我们就每人给你一千一百舍客勒银子。” And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 大利拉对参孙说：“求你告诉我，你因何有这么大的力气？当用何法捆绑克制你？” And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 参孙回答说：“人若用七条未干的青绳子捆绑我，我就软弱象别人一样。” And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 于是非利士人的首领拿了七条未干的青绳子来，交给妇人，她就用绳子捆绑参孙。 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 有人预先埋伏在妇人的内室里。妇人说：“参孙哪！非利士人拿你来了。”参孙就挣断绳子，如挣断经火的麻线一般。这样他力气的根由人还是不知道。 Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 大利拉对参孙说：“你欺哄我，向我说谎言。现在求你告诉我当用何法捆绑你？” And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 参孙回答说：“人若用没有使过的新绳捆绑我，我就软弱象别人一样。” And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 大利拉就用新绳捆绑他。对他说：“参孙哪！非利士人拿你来了。”有人预先埋伏在内室里。参孙将臂上的绳挣断了，如挣断一条线一样。 Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 大利拉对参孙说：“你到如今还是欺哄我，向我说谎言。求你告诉我，当用何法捆绑你？”参孙回答说：“你若将我头上的七条发绺，与纬线同织就可以了。” And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 于是大利拉将他的发绺与纬线同织，用橛子钉住。对他说：“参孙哪！非利士人拿你来了。”参孙从睡中醒来，将机上的橛子和纬线，一齐都拔出来了。 And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 大利拉对参孙说：“你既不与我同心，怎么说你爱我呢？你这三次欺哄我，没有告诉我，你因何有这么大的力气。” And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 大利拉天天用话催逼他，甚至他心里烦闷要死。 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 参孙就把心中所藏的都告诉了她，对她说：“向来人没有用剃头刀剃我的头，因为我自出母胎就归　神作拿细耳人；若剃了我的头发，我的力气就离开我，我便软弱象别人一样。” That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 大利拉见他把心中所藏的都告诉了她，就打发人到非利士人的首领那里，对他们说：“他已经把心中所藏的都告诉了我，请你们再上来一次。”于是非利士人的首领手里拿着银子，上到妇人那里。 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 大利拉使参孙枕着她的膝睡觉，叫了一个人来剃除他头上的七条发绺。于是大利拉克制他，他的力气就离开他了。 And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 大利拉说：“参孙哪！非利士人拿你来了。”参孙从睡中醒来，心里说，我要象前几次出去活动身体；他却不知道耶和华已经离开他了。 And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 非利士人将他拿住，剜了他的眼睛，带他下到迦萨，用铜链拘索他；他就在监里推磨。 But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 然而他的头发被剃之后，又渐渐长起来了。 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 非利士人的首领聚集，要给他们的神大衮献大祭，并且欢乐。因为他们说：“我们的神将我们的仇敌参孙交在我们手中了！” Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 众人看见参孙、就赞美他们的神，说：“我们的神将毁坏我们地、杀害我们许多人的仇敌，交在我们手中了！” And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 他们正宴乐的时候，就说：“叫参孙来！在我们面前戏耍戏耍。”于是将参孙从监里提出来，他就在众人面前戏耍。他们使他站在两柱中间。 And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 参孙向拉他手的童子说：“求你让我摸着托房的柱子，我要靠一靠。” And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 那时房内充满男女，非利士人的众首领也都在那里。房的平顶上约有三千男女，观看参孙戏耍。 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 参孙求告耶和华说：“主耶和华啊！求你眷念我。　神啊！求你赐我这一次的力量，使我在非利士人身上报那剜我双眼的仇。” And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 参孙就抱住托房的那两根柱子：左手抱一根，右手抱一根。 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 说：“我情愿与非利士人同死！”就尽力屈身，房子倒塌，压住首领和房内的众人。这样，参孙死时所杀的人，比活着所杀的还多。 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 参孙的弟兄和他父的全家，都下去取他的尸首，抬上来葬在琐拉和以实陶中间，在他父玛挪亚的坟墓里。参孙作以色列的士师二十年。 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor7_17">士师记 17</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 以法莲山地有一个人名叫米迦。 And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 他对母亲说：“你那一千一百舍客勒银子被人拿去，你因此咒诅，并且告诉了我。看哪！这银子在我这里，是我拿去了。”他母亲说：“我儿啊！愿耶和华赐福与你。” And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 米迦就把这一千一百舍客勒银子还他母亲。他母亲说：“我分出这银子来为你献给耶和华，好雕刻一个像，铸成一个像。现在我还是交给你。” And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 米迦将银子还他母亲，他母亲将二百舍客勒银子交给银匠，雕刻一个像，铸成一个像，安置在米迦的屋内。 Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 这米迦有了神堂，又制造以弗得和家中的神像，分派他一个儿子作祭司。 And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 那时以色列中没有王，各人任意而行。 In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 犹大伯利恒有一个少年人，是犹大族的利未人，他在那里寄居。 And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 这人离开犹大伯利恒城，要找一个可住的地方。行路的时候，到了以法莲山地，走到米迦的家。 And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 米迦问他说：“你从哪里来？”他回答说：“从犹大伯利恒来。我是利未人，要找一个可住的地方。” And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 米迦说：“你可以住在我这里，我以你为父、为祭司。我每年给你十舍客勒银子，一套衣服和度日的食物。”利未人就进了他的家。 And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 利未人情愿与那人同住；那人看这少年人如自己的儿子一样。 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 米迦分派这少年的利未人作祭司，他就住在米迦的家里。 And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 米迦说：“现在我知道耶和华必赐福与我，因我有一个利未人作祭司。” Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor7_18">士师记 18</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 那时以色列中没有王。但支派的人仍是寻地居住；因为到那日子，他们还没有在以色列支派中得地为业。 In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 但人从琐拉和以实陶，打发本族中的五个勇士，去仔细窥探那地。吩咐他们说：“你们去窥探那地。”他们来到以法莲山地，进了米迦的住宅，就在那里住宿。 And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 他们临近米迦的住宅，听出那少年利未人的口音来，就进去问他说：“谁领你到这里来？你在这里作什么？你在这里得什么？” When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他回答说：“米迦待我如此如此，请我作祭司。” And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他们对他说：“请你求问　神，使我们知道所行的道路，通达不通达？” And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 祭司对他们说：“你们可以平平安安地去，你们所行的道路是在耶和华面前的。” And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein ye go.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 五人就走了，来到拉亿，见那里的民安居无虑，如同西顿人安居一样。在那地没有人掌权扰乱他们；他们离西顿人也远，与别人没有来往。 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 五人回到琐拉和以实陶，见他们的弟兄。弟兄问他们说：“你们有什么话？” And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他们回答说：“起来！我们上去攻击他们吧！我们已经窥探那地，见那地甚好。你们为何静坐不动呢？要急速前往得那地为业，不可迟延。 And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still?

Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 到了家里，用刀将妾的尸身切成十二块，使人拿着传送以色列的四境。 And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 凡看见的人都说：“从以色列人出埃及地，直到今日，这样的事没有行过！也没有见过！现在应当思想，大家商议当怎样办理。” And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor7_20">士师记 20</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 于是以色列从但到别是巴，以及住基列地的众人，都出来如同一人，聚集在米斯巴耶和华面前。 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 以色列民的首领，就是各支派的军长，都站在　神百姓的会中；拿刀的步兵共有四十万。 And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 以色列人上到米斯巴，便雅悯人都听见了。以色列人说：“请你将这件恶事的情由对我们说明。” (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 那利未人，就是被害之妇人的丈夫回答说：“我和我的妾到了便雅悯的基比亚住宿。 And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 基比亚人夜间起来，围了我住的房子，想要杀我，又将我的妾强奸致死。 And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 我就把我妾的尸身切成块子，使人拿着传送以色列得为业的全地，因为基比亚人在以色列中行了凶淫丑恶的事。 And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 你们以色列人，都当筹划商议。” Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 众民都起来如同一人，说：“我们连一人都不回自己帐棚、自己房屋去。 And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 我们向基比亚人必这样行，照所掣的签去攻击他们。 But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 我们要在以色列各支派中，一百人挑取十人；一千人挑取百人；一万人挑取千人；为民运粮。等大众到了便雅悯的基比亚，就照基比亚人在以色列中所行的丑事征伐他们。” And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 于是以色列众人彼此连合如同一人，聚集攻击那城。 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 以色列众支派打发人去，问便雅悯支派的各家说：“你们中间怎么作了这样的恶事呢？ And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 现在你们要将基比亚的那些匪徒交出来，我们好治死他们，从以色列中除掉这恶。”便雅悯人却不肯听从他们弟兄以色列人的话。 Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 便雅悯人从他们的各城里出来，聚集到了基比亚，要与以色列人打仗。 But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 那时，便雅悯人从各城里点出拿刀的，共有二万六千；另外还有基比亚人点出七百精兵； And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 在众军之中有拣选的七百精兵，都是左手便利的，能用机弦甩石打人，毫发不差。 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 便雅悯人之外，点出以色列人拿刀的，共有四十万，都是战士。 And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 以色列人就起来，到伯特利去求问　神，说：“我们中间谁当首先上去与便雅悯人争战呢？”耶和华说：“犹大当先上去。” And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 以色列人早晨起来，对着基比亚安营。 And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 以色列人出来，要与便雅悯人打仗，就在基比亚前摆阵。 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 便雅悯人就从基比亚出来，当日杀死以色列人二万二千。 And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 以色列人彼此奋勇，仍在头一日摆阵的地方又摆阵。 And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 未摆阵之先，以色列人上去，在耶和华面前哭号，直到晚上，求问耶和华说：“我们再去与我们弟兄便雅悯人打仗可以不可以？”耶和华说：“可以上去攻击他们。” (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 第二日，以色列人就上前攻击便雅悯人。 And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 便雅悯人也在这日从基比亚出来，与以色列人接战，又杀死他们一万八千，都是拿刀的。 And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 以色列众人就上到伯特利，坐在耶和华面前哭号，当日禁食直到晚上。又在耶和华面前献燔祭和平安祭。 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: - And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 那时　神的约柜在那里。亚伦的孙子、以利亚撒的儿子非尼哈，侍立在约柜前，以色列人问耶和华说：“我们当再出去与我们弟兄便雅悯人打仗呢？还是罢兵呢？”耶和华说：“你们当上去，因为明日我必将他们交在你们手中。” And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 以色列人在基比亚的四围，设下伏兵。 And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 第三日，以色列人又上去攻击便雅悯人，在基比亚前摆阵，与前两次一样。 And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 便雅悯人也出来迎敌，就被引诱离城。在田间两条路上，一通伯特利，一通基比亚，象前两次，动手杀死以色列人约有三十个。 And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 便雅悯人说：“他们仍旧败在我们面前。”但以色列人说：“我们不如逃跑，引诱他们离开城到路上来。” And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 以色列众人都起来，在巴力他玛摆阵，以色列的伏兵从马利迦巴埋伏的地方冲上前去。 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 有以色列人中的一万精兵，来到基比亚前接战，势派甚是凶猛；便雅悯人却不知道灾祸临近了。 And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 耶和华使以色列人杀败便雅悯人。那日，以色列人杀死便雅悯人二万五千一百，都是拿刀的。 And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 于是便雅悯人知道自己败了。先是以色列人，因为靠着在基比亚前所设的伏兵，就在便雅悯人面前诈败。 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 伏兵急忙闯进基比亚，用刀杀死全城的人。 And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 以色列人预先同伏兵约定在城内放火，以烟气上腾为号。 Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 以色列人临退阵的时候，便雅悯人动手杀死以色列人，约有三十个。就说：“他们仍象前次被我们杀败了。” And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 当烟气如柱从城中上腾的时候，便雅悯人回头观看，见全城的烟气冲天。 But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 以色列人又转身回来，便雅悯人就甚惊惶，因为看见灾祸临到自己了。 And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 他们在以色列人面前，转身往旷野逃跑，以色列人在后面追杀；那从各城里出来的，也都夹攻杀灭他们。 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 以色列人围绕便雅悯人，追赶他们，在他们歇脚之处，对着日出之地的基比亚践踏他们。 Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 便雅悯人死了的有一万八千，都是勇士。 And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 其余的人转身向旷野逃跑，往临门磐去。以色列人在道路上杀了他们五千人，如拾取遗穗一样，追到基顿，又杀了他们二千人。 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 那日便雅悯死了的共有二万五千人，都是拿刀的勇士。 So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 只剩下六百人，转身向旷野逃跑，到了临门磐，就在那里住了四个月。 But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 以色列人又转到便雅悯地，将各城的人和牲畜，并一切所遇见的，都用刀杀尽，又放火烧了一切城邑。 And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor7_21">士师记 21</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 以色列人在米斯巴曾起誓说：“我们都不将女儿给便雅悯人为妻。” Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 以色列人来到伯特利，坐在　神面前，直到晚上放声痛哭， And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 说：“耶和华以色列的　神啊！为何以色列中有这样缺了一支派的事呢？” And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 次日清早，百姓起来，在那里筑了一座坛，献燔祭和平安祭。 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 以色列人彼此问说：“以色列各支派中，谁没有同会众上到耶和华面前来呢？”先是以色列人起过大誓说，凡不上米斯巴到耶和华面前来的，必将他治死。 And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 以色列人为他们的弟兄便雅悯后悔，说：“如今以色列中绝了一个支派了。 And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 我们既在耶和华面前起誓说，必不将我们的女儿给便雅悯人为妻，现在我们当怎样办理，使他们剩下的人有妻呢？” How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 又彼此问说：“以色列支派中谁没有上米斯巴到耶和华面前来呢？”他们就查出基列雅比没有一人进营到会众那里； And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 因为百姓被数的时候，没有一个基列雅比人在那里。 For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 会众就打发一万二千大勇士，吩咐他们说：“你们去用刀将基列雅比人连妇女带孩子都击杀了。 And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 所当行的就是这样：要将一切男子和已嫁的女子尽行杀戮。” And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他们在基列雅比人中，遇见了四百个未嫁的处女，就带到迦南地的示罗营里。 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 全会众打发人到临门磐的便雅悯人那里，向他们说和睦的话。 And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 当时便雅悯人回来了，以色列人就把所存活基列雅比的女子给他们为妻，还是不够。 And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 百姓为便雅悯人后悔，因为耶和华使以色列人缺了一个支派(原文作“使以色列中有了破口”)。 And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 会中的长老说：“便雅悯中的女子既然除灭了，我们当怎样办理，使那余剩的人有妻呢？” Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 又说：“便雅悯逃脱的人当有地业，免得以色列中涂抹了一个支派。 And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 只是我们不能将自己的女儿给他们为妻，因为以色列人曾起誓说，有将女儿给便雅悯人为妻的，必受咒诅。” Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他们又说：“在利波拿以南，伯特利以北，在示剑大路以东的示罗，年年有耶和华的节期。” Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 就吩咐便雅悯人说：“你们去，在葡萄园中埋伏。 Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 若看见示罗的女子出来跳舞，就从葡萄园出来，在示罗的女子中各抢一个为妻，回便雅悯地去。 And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 他们的父亲或是弟兄若来与我们争竞，我们就说，求你们看我们的情面，施恩给这些人，因我们在争战的时候没有给他们留下女子为妻。这也不是你们将女子给他们的，若是你们给的，就算有罪。” And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 于是便雅悯人照样而行，按着他们的数目从跳舞的女子中抢去为妻，就回自己的地业去，又重修城邑居住。 And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 当时以色列人离开那里，各归本支派、本宗族、本地业去了。 And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 那时，以色列中没有王，各人任意而行。 In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</p>
