margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 正如先知以赛亚书上记着说(有古卷无“以赛亚”三字)：“看哪！我要差遣我的使者在你前面，预备道路。 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 在旷野有人声喊着说：‘预备主的道，修直他的路。’” The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 照这话，约翰来了，在旷野施洗，传悔改的洗礼，使罪得赦。 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 犹太全地和耶路撒冷的人都出去到约翰那里，承认他们的罪，在约但河里受他的洗。 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 约翰穿骆驼毛的衣服，腰束皮带，吃的是蝗虫、野蜜。 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 他传道说：“有一位在我以后来的，能力比我更大，我就是弯腰给他解鞋带也是不配的。 And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 我是用水给你们施洗，他却要用圣灵给你们施洗。” I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 那时，耶稣从加利利的拿撒勒来，在约但河里受了约翰的洗。 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 他从水里一上来，就看见天裂开了，圣灵仿佛鸽子，降在他身上。 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 又有声音从天上来说：“你是我的爱子，我喜悦你。” And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 圣灵就把耶稣催到旷野里去。 And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他在旷野四十天受撒但的试探，并与野兽同在一处，且有天使来伺候他。 And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 约翰下监以后，耶稣来到加利利，宣传　神的福音， Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 说：“日期满了，　神的国近了！你们当悔改，信福音。” And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 耶稣顺着加利利的海边走，看见西门和西门的兄弟安得烈在海里撒网；他们本是打鱼的。 Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 耶稣对他们说：“来跟从我，我要叫你们得人如得鱼一样。” And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 他们就立刻舍了网，跟从了他。 And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 耶稣稍往前走，又见西庇太的儿子雅各和雅各的兄弟约翰在船上补网。 And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 耶稣随即招呼他们，他们就把父亲西庇太和雇工人留在船上，跟从耶稣去了。 And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 到了迦百农，耶稣就在安息日进了会堂教训人。 And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 众人很希奇他的教训，因为他教训他们，正象有权柄的人，不象文士。 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 在会堂里，有一个人被污鬼附着。他喊叫说： And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: “拿撒勒人耶稣，我们与你有什么相干？你来灭我们吗？我知道你是谁，乃是　神的圣者。” Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 耶稣责备他说：“不要作声，从这人身上出来吧。” And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 污鬼叫那人抽了一阵风，大声喊叫，就出来了。 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 众人都惊讶，以致彼此对问说：“这是什么事？是个新道理啊！他用权柄吩咐污鬼，连污鬼也听从了他。” And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 耶稣的名声就传遍了加利利的四方。 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 他们一出会堂，就同着雅各、约翰，进了西门和安得烈的家。 And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 西门的岳母正害热病躺着，就有人告诉耶稣。 But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 耶稣进前拉着她的手，扶她起来，热就退了，她就服事他们。 And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 天晚日落的时候，有人带着一切害病的，和被鬼附的，来到耶稣跟前。 And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 合城的人都聚集在门前。 And all the city was gathered together at the door.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 耶稣治好了许多害各样病的人，又赶出许多鬼，不许鬼说话，因为鬼认识他。 And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 次日早晨，天未亮的时候，耶稣起来，到旷野地方去，在那里祷告。 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 西门和同伴追了他去； And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 遇见了就对他说：“众人都找你。” And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 耶稣对他们说：“我们可以往别处去，到邻近的乡村，我也好在那里传道，因为我是为这事出来的。” And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 于是在加利利全地，进了会堂，传道赶鬼。 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 有一个长大麻风的来求耶稣，向他跪下，说：“你若肯，必能叫我洁净了。” And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 耶稣动了慈心，就伸手摸他，说：“我肯，你洁净了吧！” And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 大麻风即时离开他，他就洁净了。 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 耶稣严严地嘱咐他，就打发他走， And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 对他说：“你要谨慎，什么话都不可告诉人，只要去把身体给祭司察看，又因为你洁净了，献上摩西所吩咐的礼物，对众人作证据。” And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 那人出去，倒说许多的话，把这件事传扬开了，叫耶稣以后不得再明明地进城，只好在外边旷野地方。人从各处都就了他来。 But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor41_2">马可福音 2</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 过了些日子，耶稣又进了迦百农。人听见他在房子里， And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 就有许多人聚集，甚至连门前都没有空地，耶稣就对他们讲道。 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 有人带着一个瘫子来见耶稣，是用四个人抬来的； And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 因为人多，不得近前，就把耶稣所在的房子，拆了房顶，既拆通了，就把瘫子连所躺卧的褥子都缒下来。 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 耶稣见他们的信心，就对瘫子说：“小子，你的罪赦了。” When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 有几个文士坐在那里，心里议论，说： But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: “这个人为什么这样说呢？他说僭妄的话了，除了　神以外，谁能赦罪呢？” Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 耶稣心中知道他们心里这样议论，就说：“你们心里为什么这样议论呢？ And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 或对瘫子说：‘你的罪赦了；’或说：‘起来！拿你的褥子行走；’哪一样容易呢？ Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 但要叫你们知道，人子在地上有赦罪的权柄。”就对瘫子说： But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: “我吩咐你，起来！拿你的褥子回家去吧。” I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 那人就起来，立刻拿着褥子，当众人面前出去了；以致众人都惊奇，归荣耀与　神说：“我们从来没有见过这样的事。” And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 耶稣又出到海边去，众人都就了他来，他便教训他们。 And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 耶稣经过的时候，看见亚勒腓的儿子利未坐在税关上，就对他说：“你跟从我来。”他就起来，跟从了耶稣。 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 耶稣在利未家里坐席的时候，有好些税吏和罪人与耶稣并门徒一同坐席；因为这样的人多，他们也跟随耶稣。 And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 法利赛人中的文士(有古卷作“文士和法利赛人”)看见耶稣和罪人并税吏一同吃饭，就对他门徒说：“他和税吏并罪人一同吃喝吗？” And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 耶稣听见，就对他们说：“康健的人用不着医生，有病的人才用得着，我来本不是召义人，乃是召罪人。” When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 当下，约翰的门徒和法利赛人禁食。他们来问耶稣说：“约翰的门徒和法利赛人的门徒禁食，你的门徒倒不禁食，这是为什么呢？” And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 耶稣对他们说：“新郎和陪伴之人同在的时候，陪伴之人岂能禁食呢？新郎还同在，他们不能禁食。 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 但日子将到，新郎要离开他们，那日他们就要禁食。 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 没有人把新布缝在旧衣服上，恐怕所补上的新布带坏了旧衣服，破的就更大了。 No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 也没有人把新酒装在旧皮袋里，恐怕酒把皮袋裂开，酒和皮袋就都坏了；惟把新酒装在新皮袋里。” And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 耶稣当安息日从麦地经过。他门徒行路的时候，掐了麦穗。 And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 法利赛人对耶稣说：“看哪！他们在安息日为什么作不可作的事呢？” And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 耶稣对他们说：“经上记着大卫和跟从他的人缺乏饥饿之时所作的事，你们没有念过吗？ And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 他当亚比亚他作大祭司的时候，怎么进了　神的殿，吃了陈设饼，又给跟从他的人吃。这饼除了祭司以外，人都不可吃。” How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 又对他们说：“安息日是为人设立的，人不是为安息日设立的； And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 所以人子也是安息日的主。” Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor41_3">马可福音 3</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶稣又进了会堂；在那里有一个人枯干了一只手。 And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 众人窥探耶稣，在安息日医治不医治，意思是要控告耶稣。 And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 耶稣对那枯干一只手的人说：“起来，站在当中。” And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 又问众人说：“在安息日行善行恶，救命害命，哪样是可以的呢？”他们都不作声。 And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 耶稣怒目周围看他们，忧愁他们的心刚硬，就对那人说：“伸出手来！”他把手一伸，手就复了原。 And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 法利赛人出去，同希律一党的人商议，怎样可以除灭耶稣。 And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 耶稣和门徒退到海边去，有许多人从加利利跟随他。 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 还有许多人听见他所作的大事，就从犹太、耶路撒冷、以土买、约但河外，并推罗、西顿的四方，来到他那里。 And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他因为人多，就吩咐门徒叫一只小船伺候着，免得众人拥挤他。 And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 他治好了许多人，所以凡有灾病的，都挤进来要摸他。 For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 污鬼无论何时看见他，就俯伏在他面前，喊着说：“你是　神的儿子。” And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 耶稣再三地嘱咐他们，不要把他显露出来。 And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 耶稣上了山，随自己的意思叫人来，他们便来到他那里。 And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他就设立十二个人，要他们常和自己同在，也要差他们去传道， And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 并给他们权柄赶鬼。 And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 这十二个人有西门，耶稣又给他起名叫彼得； And Simon he surnamed Peter;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 还有西庇太的儿子雅各，和雅各的兄弟约翰，又给这两个人起名叫半尼其，就是雷子的意思； And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 又有安得烈、腓力、巴多罗买、马太、多马、亚勒腓的儿子雅各，和达太，并奋锐党的西门； And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 还有卖耶稣的加略人犹大。 And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 耶稣进了一个屋子，众人又聚集，甚至他连饭也顾不得吃。 And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 耶稣的亲属听见，就出来要拉住他，因为他们说他癫狂了。 And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 从耶路撒冷下来的文士说：“他是被别西卜附着；”又说：“他是靠着鬼王赶鬼。” And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 耶稣叫他们来，用比喻对他们说：“撒但怎能赶出撒但呢？ And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 若一国自相纷争，那国就站立不住； And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 若一家自相纷争，那家就站立不住。 And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 若撒但自相攻打纷争，他就站立不住，必要灭亡。 And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 没有人能进壮士家里，抢夺他的家具；必先捆住那壮士，才可以抢夺他的家。 No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 我实在告诉你们，世人一切的罪和一切亵渎的话，都可得赦免； Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 凡亵渎圣灵的，却永不得赦免，乃要担当永远的罪。” But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 这话是因为他们说：“他是被污鬼附着的。” Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 当下，耶稣的母亲和弟兄来站在外边，打发人去叫他。 There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 有许多人在耶稣周围坐着，他们就告诉他说：“看哪！你母亲和你弟兄在外边找你。” And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 耶稣回答说：“谁是我的母亲？谁是我的弟兄？” And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 就四面观看那周围坐着的人，说：“看哪！我的母亲，我的弟兄。 And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 凡遵行　神旨意的人，就是我的弟兄姐妹和母亲了。” For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor41_4">马可福音 4</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶稣又在海边教训人。有许多人到他那里聚集，他只得上船坐下。船在海里，众人都靠近海站在岸上。 And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 耶稣就用比喻教训他们许多道理。在教训之间，对他们说： And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: “你们听啊，有一个撒种的出去撒种。 Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 撒的时候，有落在路旁的，飞鸟来吃尽了。 And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 有落在土浅石头地上的，土既不深，发苗最快； And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 日头出来一晒，因为没有根，就枯干了。 But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 有落在荆棘里的，荆棘长起来，把它挤住了，就不结实。 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 又有落在好土里的，就发生长大，结实有三十倍的，有六十倍的，有一百倍的。” And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 又说：“有耳可听的，就应当听。” And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 无人的时候，跟随耶稣的人和十二个门徒问他这比喻的意思。 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 耶稣对他们说：“　神国的奥秘，只叫你们知道；若是对外人讲，凡事就用比喻， And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 叫他们看是看见，却不晓得；听是听见，却不明白；恐怕他们回转过来，就得赦免。” That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 又对他们说：“你们不明白这比喻吗？这样怎能明白一切的比喻呢？ And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 撒种之人所撒的，就是道， The sower soweth the word.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 那撒在路旁的，就是人听了道，撒但立刻来，把撒在他心里的道夺了去。 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 那撒在石头地上的，就是人听了道，立刻欢喜领受； And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 但他心里没有根，不过是暂时的；及至为道遭了患难，或是受了逼迫，立刻就跌倒了。 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 还有那撒在荆棘里的，就是人听了道。 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 后来有世上的思虑、钱财的迷惑，和别样的私欲；进来把道挤住了，就不能结实。 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 那撒在好地上的，就是人听道，又领受，并且结实，有三十倍的，有六十倍的，有一百倍的。” And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 耶稣又对他们说：“人拿灯来，岂是要放在斗底下，床底下，不放在灯台上吗？ And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 因为掩藏的事，没有不显出来的；隐瞒的事，没有不露出来的。 For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 有耳可听的，就应当听。” If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 又说：“你们所听的要留心。你们用什么量器量给人，也必用什么量器量给你们，并且要多给你们。 And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 因为有的，还要给他；没有的，连他所有的也要夺去。” For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 又说：“　神的国如同人把种撒在地上。 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 黑夜睡觉，白日起来，这种就发芽渐长，那人却不晓得如何这样。 And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 地生五谷是出于自然的：先发苗，后长穗，再后穗上结成饱满的子粒。 For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 谷既熟了，就用镰刀去割，因为收成的时候到了。” But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 又说：“　神的国，我们可用什么比较呢？可用什么比喻表明呢？ And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 好象一粒芥菜种，种在地里的时候，虽比地上的百种都小； It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 但种上以后，就长起来，比各样的菜都大，又长出大枝来，甚至天上的飞鸟可以宿在它的荫下。” But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 耶稣用许多这样的比喻，照他们所能听的，对他们讲道。 And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 若不用比喻，就不对他们讲。没有人的时候，就把一切的道讲给门徒听。 But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 当那天晚上，耶稣对门徒说：“我们渡到那边去吧。” And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 门徒离开众人，耶稣仍在船上，他们就把他一同带去；也有别的船和他同行。 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 忽然起了暴风，波浪打入船内，甚至船要满了水。 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 耶稣在船尾上，枕着枕头睡觉。门徒叫醒了他，说：“夫子！我们丧命，你不顾吗？” And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 耶稣醒了，斥责风，向海说：“住了吧！静了吧！”风就止住，大大地平静了。 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 耶稣对他们说：“为什么胆怯？你们还没有信心吗？” And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 他们就大大地惧怕，彼此说：“这到底是谁，连风和海也听从他了。” And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor41_5">马可福音 5</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 他们来到海那边格拉森人的地方。 And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 耶稣一下船，就有一个被污鬼附着的人，从坟茔里出来迎着他。 And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 那人常住在坟茔里，没有人能捆住他，就是用铁链也不能； Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 因为人屡次用脚镣和铁链捆锁他，铁链竟被他挣断了，脚镣也被他弄碎了；总没有人能制伏他。 Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他昼夜常在坟茔里和山中喊叫，又用石头砍自己。 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他远远地看见耶稣，就跑过去拜他， But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 大声呼叫说：“至高　神的儿子耶稣，我与你有什么相干？我指着　神恳求你，不要叫我受苦！” And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 是因耶稣曾吩咐他说：“污鬼啊，从这人身上出来吧。” For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 耶稣问他说：“你名叫什么？”回答说：“我名叫群，因为我们多的缘故；” And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 就再三地求耶稣，不要叫他们离开那地方。 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 在那里山坡上，有一大群猪吃食。 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 鬼就央求耶稣说：“求你打发我们往猪群里附着猪去。” And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 耶稣准了他们，污鬼就出来，进入猪里去。于是那群猪闯下山崖，投在海里，淹死了。猪的数目约有二千。 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 放猪的就逃跑了，去告诉城里和乡下的人。众人就来，要看是什么事。 And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 他们来到耶稣那里，看见那被鬼附着的人，就是从前被群鬼所附的，坐着，穿上衣服，心里明白过来，他们就害怕。 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 看见这事的，便将鬼附之人所遇见的，和那群猪的事，都告诉了众人。 And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 众人就央求耶稣离开他们的境界。 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 耶稣上船的时候，那从前被鬼附着的人恳求和耶稣同在。 And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 耶稣不许，却对他说：“你回家去，到你的亲属那里，将主为你所作的是何等大的事，是怎样怜悯你，都告诉他们。” Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 那人就走了，在低加波利传扬耶稣为他作了何等大的事，众人就都希奇。 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 耶稣坐船又渡到那边去，就有许多人到他那里聚集；他正在海边上。 And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 有一个管会堂的人，名叫睚鲁，来见耶稣，就俯伏在他脚前， And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 再三地求他说：“我的小女儿快要死了，求你去按手在她身上，使她痊愈，得以活了。” And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 耶稣就和他同去。有许多人跟随拥挤他。 And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 有一个女人，患了十二年的血漏， And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 在好些医生手里受了许多的苦，又花尽了她所有的，一点也不见好，病势反倒更重了。 And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 她听见耶稣的事，就从后头来，杂在众人中间，摸耶稣的衣裳； When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 意思说：“我只摸他的衣裳，就必痊愈。” For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 于是她血漏的源头立刻干了，她便觉得身上的灾病好了。 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 耶稣顿时心里觉得有能力从自己身上出去，就在众人中间转过来，说：“谁摸我的衣裳？” And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 门徒对他说：“你看众人拥挤你，还说‘谁摸我’吗？” And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 耶稣周围观看，要见作这事的女人。 And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 那女人知道在自己身上所成的事，就恐惧战兢，来俯伏在耶稣跟前，将实情全告诉他。 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 耶稣对她说：“女儿，你的信救了你，平平安安地回去吧！你的灾病痊愈了。” And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 还说话的时候，有人从管会堂的家里来，说：“你的女儿死了，何必还劳动先生呢？” While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 耶稣听见所说的话，就对管会堂的说：“不要怕！只要信！” As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 于是带着彼得、雅各，和雅各的兄弟约翰同去，不许别人跟随他。 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 他们来到管会堂的家里，耶稣看见那里乱嚷，并有人大大地哭泣哀号。 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 进到里面，就对他们说：“为什么乱嚷哭泣呢？孩子不是死了，是睡着了。” And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 他们就嗤笑耶稣。耶稣把他们都撵出去，就带着孩子的父母，和跟随的人进了孩子所在的地方； And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 就拉着孩子的手。对她说：“大利大古米！”(翻出来就是说：“闺女，我吩咐你起来！”) And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 那闺女立时起来走；他们就大大地惊奇；闺女已经十二岁了。 And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 耶稣切切地嘱咐他们，不要叫人知道这事；又吩咐给她东西吃。 And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor41_6">马可福音 6</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶稣离开那里，来到自己的家乡；门徒也跟从他。 And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 到了安息日，他在会堂里教训人。众人听见，就甚希奇，说：“这人从哪里有这些事呢？所赐给他的是什么智慧？他手所作的是何等的异能呢？ And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 这不是那木匠吗？不是马利亚的儿子，雅各、约西、犹大、西门的长兄吗？他妹妹们不也是在我们这里吗？”他们就厌弃他(“厌弃他”原文作“因他跌倒”)。 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 耶稣对他们说：“大凡先知，除了本地亲属本家之外，没有不被人尊敬的。” But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 耶稣就在那里不得行什么异能，不过按手在几个病人身上，治好他们。 And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他也诧异他们不信，就往周围乡村教训人去了。 And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 耶稣叫了十二个门徒来，差遣他们两个两个地出去；也赐给他们权柄，制伏污鬼； And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 并且嘱咐他们；行路的时候不要带食物和口袋，腰袋里也不要带钱，除了拐杖以外，什么都不要带； And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 只要穿鞋，也不要穿两件褂子。 But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 又对他们说：“你们无论到何处，进了人的家，就住在那里，直到离开那地方。 And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 何处的人不接待你们，不听你们，你们离开那里的时候，就把脚上的尘土跺下去，对他们作见证。” And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 门徒就出去传道，叫人悔改； And they went out, and preached that men should repent.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 又赶出许多的鬼，用油抹了许多病人，治好他们。 And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 耶稣的名声传扬出来。希律王听见了，就说：“施洗的约翰从死里复活了，所以这些异能由他里面发出来。” And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 但别人说：“是以利亚；”又有人说：“是先知，正象先知中的一位。” Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 希律听见却说：“是我所斩的约翰，他复活了。” But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 先是希律为他兄弟腓力的妻子希罗底的缘故，差人去拿住约翰，锁在监里，因为希律已经娶了那妇人。 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 约翰曾对希律说：“你娶你兄弟的妻子是不合理的。” For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 于是希罗底怀恨他，想要杀他，只是不能； Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 因为希律知道约翰是义人，是圣人，所以敬畏他，保护他，听他讲论，就多照着行，并且乐意听他(“多照着行”有古卷作“游移不定”)。 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 有一天，恰巧是希律的生日，希律摆设筵席，请了大臣和千夫长，并加利利作首领的。 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 希罗底的女儿进来跳舞，使希律和同席的人都欢喜，王就对女子说：“你随意向我求什么，我必给你；” And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 又对她起誓说：“随你向我求什么，就是我国的一半，我也必给你。” And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 她就出去对她母亲说：“我可以求什么呢？”她母亲说：“施洗约翰的头。” And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 她就急忙进去见王，求他说：“我愿王立时把施洗约翰的头放在盘子里给我。” And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 王就甚忧愁；但因他所起的誓，又因同席的人，就不肯推辞， And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 随即差一个护卫兵，吩咐拿约翰的头来。护卫兵就去在监里斩了约翰， And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 把头放在盘子里，拿来给女子；女子就给她母亲。 And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 约翰的门徒听见了，就来把他的尸首领去，葬在坟墓里。 And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 使徒聚集到耶稣那里，将一切所作的事、所传的道，全告诉他。 And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 他就说：“你们来，同我暗暗地到旷野地方去歇一歇。”这是因为来往的人多，他们连吃饭也没有工夫。 And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 他们就坐船，暗暗地往旷野地方去。 And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 众人看见他们去，有许多认识他们的，就从各城步行，一同跑到那里，比他们先赶到了。 And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 耶稣出来，见有许多的人，就怜悯他们，因为他们如同羊没有牧人一般；于是开口教训他们许多道理。 And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 天已经晚了，门徒进前来，说：“这是野地，天已经晚了， And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 请叫众人散开，他们好往四面乡村里去，自己买什么吃。” Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 耶稣回答说：“你们给他们吃吧。”门徒说：“我们可以去买二十两银子的饼，给他们吃吗？” He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 耶稣说：“你们有多少饼，可以去看看。”他们知道了，就说：“五个饼，两条鱼。” He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 耶稣吩咐他们，叫众人一帮一帮地坐在青草地上。 And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 众人就一排一排地坐下，有一百一排的，有五十一排的。 And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 耶稣拿着这五个饼，两条鱼，望着天祝福，掰开饼，递给门徒，摆在众人面前，也把那两条鱼分给众人。 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 他们都吃，并且吃饱了。 And they did all eat, and were filled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 门徒就把碎饼碎鱼收拾起来，装满了十二个篮子。 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 吃饼的男人，共有五千。 And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 耶稣随即催门徒上船，先渡到那边伯赛大去，等他叫众人散开。 And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 他既辞别了他们，就往山上去祷告。 And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 到了晚上，船在海中，耶稣独自在岸上； And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 看见门徒因风不顺，摇橹甚苦；夜里约有四更天，就在海面上走，往他们那里去，意思要走过他们去。 And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 但门徒看见他在海面上走，以为是鬼怪，就喊叫起来； But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 因为他们都看见了他，且甚惊慌。耶稣连忙对他们说：“你们放心！是我，不要怕！” For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: 于是到他们那里上了船，风就住了；他们心里十分惊奇。 And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">52: 这是因为他们不明白那分饼的事，心里还是愚顽。 For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">53: 既渡过去，来到革尼撒勒地方，就靠了岸。 And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">54: 一下船，众人认得是耶稣； And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">55: 就跑遍那一带地方，听见他在何处，便将有病的人用褥子抬到那里。 And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">56: 凡耶稣所到的地方，或村中、或城里、或乡间，他们都将病人放在街市上，求耶稣只容他们摸他的衣裳繸子；凡摸着的人就都好了。 And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor41_7">马可福音 7</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 有法利赛人和几个文士从耶路撒冷来，到耶稣那里聚集。 Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 他们曾看见他的门徒中有人用俗手，就是没有洗的手，吃饭。 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: (原来法利赛人和犹太人，都拘守古人的遗传，若不仔细洗手就不吃饭； For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 从市上来，若不洗浴也不吃饭；还有好些别的规矩，他们历代拘守，就是洗杯、罐、铜器等物。) And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 法利赛人和文士问他说：“你的门徒为什么不照古人的遗传，用俗手吃饭呢？” Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 耶稣说：“以赛亚指着你们假冒为善之人所说的预言，是不错的。如经上说：‘这百姓用嘴唇尊敬我，心却远离我。 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 他们将人的吩咐，当作道理教导人，所以拜我也是枉然。’ Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 你们是离弃　神的诫命，拘守人的遗传。” For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 又说：“你们诚然是废弃　神的诫命，要守自己的遗传。 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 摩西说：‘当孝敬父母；’又说：‘咒骂父母的，必治死他。’ For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 你们倒说：‘人若对父母说：我所当奉给你的，已经作了各耳板’(各耳板，就是供献的意思)， But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 以后你们就不容他再奉养父母。 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 这就是你们承接遗传，废了　神的道。你们还作许多这样的事。” Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 耶稣又叫众人来，对他们说：“你们都要听我的话，也要明白。 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 从外面进去的，不能污秽人，惟有从里面出来的，乃能污秽人。”(有古卷在此有 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: “有耳可听的，就应当听。”) If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 耶稣离开众人，进了屋子，门徒就问他这比喻的意思。 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 耶稣对他们说：“你们也是这样不明白吗？岂不晓得凡从外面进入的，不能污秽人， And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 因为不是入他的心，乃是入他的肚腹，又落到茅厕里。”(这是说，各样的食物都是洁净的。) Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 又说：“从人里面出来的，那才能污秽人， And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 因为从里面，就是从人心里，发出恶念、苟合、 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 偷盗、凶杀、奸淫、贪婪、邪恶、诡诈、淫荡、嫉妒、谤讟、骄傲、狂妄。 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 这一切的恶，都是从里面出来，且能污秽人。” All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 耶稣从那里起身，往推罗、西顿的境内去；进了一家，不愿意人知道，却隐藏不住。 And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 当下有一个妇人，她的小女儿被污鬼附着，听见耶稣的事，就来俯伏在他脚前。 For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 耶稣对她说：“让儿女们先吃饱，不好拿儿女的饼丢给狗吃。” But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 妇人回答说：“主啊，不错；但是狗在桌子底下也吃孩子们的碎渣儿。” And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 耶稣对她说：“因这句话，你回去吧；鬼已经离开你的女儿了。” And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 她就回家去，见小孩子躺在床上，鬼已经出去了。 And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 耶稣又离了推罗的境界，经过西顿，就从低加波利境内来到加利利海。 And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 有人带着一个耳聋舌结的人来见耶稣，求他按手在他身上。 And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 耶稣领他离开众人，到一边去，就用指头探他的耳朵，吐唾沫抹他的舌头， And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 望天叹息，对他说：“以法大！”就是说：“开了吧！” And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 他的耳朵就开了，舌结也解了，说话也清楚了。 And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 耶稣嘱咐他们不要告诉人；但他越发嘱咐，他们越发传扬开了。 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 众人分外希奇，说：“他所作的事都好，他连聋子也叫他们听见，哑巴也叫他们说话。” And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor41_8">马可福音 8</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

And they said, Seven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他吩咐众人坐在地上，就拿着这七个饼祝谢了，掰开，递给门徒，叫他们摆开，门徒就摆在众人面前。 And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 又有几条小鱼；耶稣祝了福，就吩咐也摆在众人面前。 And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 众人都吃，并且吃饱了，收拾剩下的零碎，有七筐子。 So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 人数约有四千。耶稣打发他们走了， And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 随即同门徒上船，来到大玛努他境内。 And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 法利赛人出来盘问耶稣，求他从天上显个神迹给他们看，想要试探他。 And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 耶稣心里深深地叹息说：“这世代为什么求神迹呢？我实在告诉你们，没有神迹给这世代看。” And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他就离开他们，又上船往海那边去了。 And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 门徒忘了带饼；在船上除了一个饼，没有别的食物。 Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 耶稣嘱咐他们说：“你们要谨慎，防备法利赛人的酵和希律的酵。” And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 他们彼此议论说：“这是因为我们没有饼吧！” And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 耶稣看出来，就说：“你们为什么因为没有饼就议论呢？你们还不省悟，还不明白吗？你们的心还是愚顽吗？ And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 你们有眼睛，看不见吗？有耳朵，听不见吗？也不记得吗？ Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 我掰开那五个饼分给五千人，你们收拾的零碎，装满了多少篮子呢？”他们说：“十二个。” When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: “又掰开那七个饼分给四千人，你们收拾的零碎，装满了多少筐子呢？”他们说：“七个。” And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 耶稣说：“你们还是不明白吗？” And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 他们来到伯赛大，有人带一个瞎子来，求耶稣摸他。 And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 耶稣拉着瞎子的手，领他到村外，就吐唾沫在他眼睛上，按手在他身上，问他说：“你看见什么了？” And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 他就抬头一看，说：“我看见人了。他们好象树木，并且行走。” And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 随后又按手在他眼睛上，他定睛一看，就复了原，样样都看得清楚了。 After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 耶稣打发他回家，说：“连这村子你也不要进去。” And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 耶稣和门徒出去，往该撒利亚腓立比的村庄去。在路上问门徒说：“人说我是谁？” And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 他们说：“有人说是施洗的约翰；有人说是以利亚；又有人说是先知里的一位。” And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 又问他们说：“你们说我是谁？”彼得回答说：“你是基督。” And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 耶稣就禁戒他们，不要告诉人。 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 从此他教训他们说：“人子必须受许多的苦，被长老、祭司长和文士弃绝，并且被杀，过三天复活。” And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 耶稣明明地说这话，彼得就拉着他，劝他。 And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 耶稣转过来，看着门徒，就责备彼得说：“撒但，退我后边去吧！因为你不体贴　神的意思，只体贴人的意思。” But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 于是叫众人和门徒来，对他们说：“若有人要跟从我，就当舍己，背起他的十字架，来跟从我。 And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 因为凡要救自己生命的(“生命”或作“灵魂”。下同。)，必丧掉生命；凡为我和福音丧掉生命的，必救了生命。 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 人就是赚得全世界，赔上自己的生命，有什么益处呢？ For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 人还能拿什么换生命呢？ Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 凡在这淫乱罪恶的世代，把我和我的道当作可耻的，人子在他父的荣耀里，同圣天使降临的时候，也要把那人当作可耻的。” Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor41_9">马可福音 9</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶稣又对他们说：“我实在告诉你们，站在这里的，有人在没尝死味以前，必要看见　神的国大有能力临到。” And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 过了六天，耶稣带着彼得、雅各、约翰，暗暗地上了高山，就在他们面前变了形象； And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 衣服放光，极其洁白，地上漂布的，没有一个能漂得那样白。 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 忽然有以利亚同摩西向他们显现，并且和耶稣说话。 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 彼得对耶稣说：“拉比(“拉比”就是“夫子)，我们在这里真好！可以搭三座棚，一座为你，一座为摩西，一座为以利亚。” And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 彼得不知道说什么才好，因为他们甚是惧怕， For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 有一朵云彩来遮盖他们；也有声音从云彩里出来说：“这是我的爱子，你们要听他。” And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 门徒忽然周围一看，不再见一人，只见耶稣同他们在那里。 And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 下山的时候，耶稣嘱咐他们说：“人子还没有从死里复活，你们不要将所看见的告诉人。” And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 门徒将这话存记在心，彼此议论“从死里复活”是什么意思。 And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 他们就问耶稣说：“文士为什么说以利亚必须先来？” And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 耶稣说：“以利亚固然先来，复兴万事。经上不是指着人子说，他要受许多的苦，被人轻慢呢！ And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我告诉你们，以利亚已经来了，他们也任意待他，正如经上所指着他的话。” But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 耶稣到了门徒那里，看见有许多人围着他们，又有文士和他们辩论。 And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 众人一见耶稣，都甚希奇，就跑上去问他的安。 And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 耶稣问他们说：“你们和他们辩论的是什么？” And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 众人中间有一个人回答说：“夫子，我带了我的儿子到你这里来，他被哑巴鬼附着。 And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 无论在哪里，鬼捉弄他，把他摔倒，他就口中流沫，咬牙切齿，身体枯干。我请过你的门徒把鬼赶出去，他们却是不能。” And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 耶稣说：“嗳！不信的世代啊，我在你们这里要到几时呢？我忍耐你们要到几时呢？把他带到我这里来吧。” He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 他们就带了他来。他一见耶稣，鬼便叫他重重地抽风，倒在地上，翻来复去，口中流沫。 And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 耶稣问他父亲说：“他得这病有多少日子呢？”回答说：“从小的时候。 And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 鬼屡次把他扔在火里，水里，要灭他。你若能作什么，求你怜悯我们，帮助我们。” And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 耶稣对他说：“你若能信，在信的人，凡事都能。” Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 孩子的父亲立时喊着说：“我信，但我信不足，求主帮助(有古卷作“立时流泪地喊着说”)。” And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 耶稣看见众人都跑上来，就斥责那污鬼，说：“你这聋哑的鬼，我吩咐你从他里头出来，再不要进去！” When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 那鬼喊叫，使孩子大大地抽了一阵风，就出来了。孩子好象死了一般，以致众人多半说：“他是死了。” And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 但耶稣拉着他的手，扶他起来，他就站起来了。 But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 耶稣进了屋子，门徒就暗暗地问他说：“我们为什么不能赶出他去呢？” And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 耶稣说：“非用祷告(有古卷在此有“禁食”二字)，这一类的鬼，总不能出来(或作“不能赶他出来”)。” And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 他们离开那地方，经过加利利。耶稣不愿意人知道； And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 于是教训门徒，说：“人子将要被交在人手里，他们要杀害他；被杀以后，过三天他要复活。” For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 门徒却不明白这话，又不敢问他。 But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 他们来到迦百农。耶稣在屋里问门徒说：“你们在路上议论的是什么？” And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 门徒不作声，因为他们在路上彼此争论谁为大。 But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 耶稣坐下，叫十二个门徒来，说：“若有人愿意作首先的，他必作众人末后的，作众人的用人。” And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 于是领过一个小孩子来，叫他站在门徒中间；又抱起他来，对他们说： And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: “凡为我名接待一个象这小孩子的，就是接待我；凡接待我的，不是接待我，乃是接待那差我来的。” Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 约翰对耶稣说：“夫子，我们看见一个人奉你的名赶鬼，我们就禁止他，因为他不跟从我们。” And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 耶稣说：“不要禁止他，因为没有人奉我名行异能，反倒轻易毁谤我。 But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 不敌挡我们的，就是帮助我们的。 For he that is not against us is on our part.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 凡因你们是属基督，给你们一杯水喝的，我实在告诉你们，他不能不得赏赐。” For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: “凡使这信我的一个小子跌倒的，倒不如把大磨石拴在这人的颈项上，扔在海里。 And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 倘若你一只手叫你跌倒，就把它砍下来； And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 你缺了肢体进入永生，强如有两只手落到地狱，入那不灭的火里去。 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 倘若你一只脚叫你跌倒，就把它砍下来； And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 你瘸腿进入永生，强如有两只脚被丢在地狱里。 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 倘若你一只眼叫你跌倒，就去掉它；你只有一只眼进入　神的国，强如有两只眼被丢在地狱里。 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 在那里，虫是不死的，火是不灭的。 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 因为必用火当盐腌各人(有古卷在此有“凡祭物必用盐腌”)。 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 到了时候，打发一个仆人到园户那里，要从园户收葡萄园的果子。 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 园户拿住他，打了他，叫他空手回去。 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 再打发一个仆人到他们那里。他们打伤他的头，并且凌辱他。 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 又打发一个仆人去，他们就杀了他。后又打发好些仆人去，有被他们打的，有被他们杀的。 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 园主还有一位，是他的爱子；末后又打发他去，意思说：‘他们必尊敬我的儿子。’ Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 不料，那些园户彼此说：‘这是承受产业的，来吧，我们杀他！产业就归我们了。’ But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 于是拿住他，杀了他，把他丢在园外。 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 这样，葡萄园的主人要怎样办呢？他要来除灭那些园户，将葡萄园转给别人。 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 经上写着说：‘匠人所弃的石头，已作了房角的头块石头。 And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 这是主所作的，在我们眼中看为希奇。’这经你们没有念过吗？” This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他们看出这比喻是指着他们说的，就想要捉拿他，只是惧怕百姓；于是离开他走了。 And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 后来，他们打发几个法利赛人和几个希律党的人到耶稣那里，要就着他的话陷害他。 And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他们来了，就对他说：“夫子，我们知道你是诚实的，什么人你都不徇情面，因为你不看人的外貌，乃是诚诚实实传　神的道。纳税给凯撒可以不可以？ And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 我们该纳不该纳？”耶稣知道他们的假意，就对他们说：“你们为什么试探我？拿一个银钱来给我看！” Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 他们就拿了来。耶稣说：“这像和这号是谁的？”他们说：“是凯撒的。” And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 耶稣说：“凯撒的物当归给凯撒，　神的物当归给　神。”他们就很希奇他。 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 撒都该人常说没有复活的事。他们来问耶稣说： Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: “夫子，摩西为我们写着说：‘人若死了，撇下妻子，没有孩子，他兄弟当娶他的妻，为哥哥生子立后。’ Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 有弟兄七人，第一个娶了妻，死了，没有留下孩子。 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 第二个娶了她，也死了，没有留下孩子。第三个也是这样。 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 那七个人都没有留下孩子；末了，那妇人也死了。 And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 当复活的时候，她是哪一个的妻子呢？因为他们七个人都娶过她。” In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 耶稣说：“你们所以错了；岂不是因为不明白圣经，不晓得　神的大能吗？ And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 人从死里复活，也不娶也不嫁，乃象天上的使者一样。 For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 论到死人复活，你们没有念过摩西的书荆棘篇上所载的吗？　神对摩西说：‘我是亚伯拉罕的　神，以撒的　神，雅各的　神。’ And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 　神不是死人的　神，乃是活人的　神。你们是大错了。” He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 有一个文士来，听见他们辩论，晓得耶稣回答得好，就问他说：“诫命中哪是第一要紧的呢？” And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 耶稣回答说：“第一要紧的，就是说：‘以色列啊，你要听，主我们　神，是独一的主。 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 你要尽心、尽性、尽意、尽力爱主你的　神。’ And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 其次就是说：‘要爱人如己。’再没有比这两条诫命更大的了。” And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 那文士对耶稣说：“夫子说，　神是一位，实在不错；除了他以外，再没有别的　神； And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 并且尽心、尽智、尽力爱他，又爱人如己，就比一切燔祭和各样祭祀好得多。” And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 耶稣见他回答得有智慧，就对他说：“你离　神的国不远了。”从此以后，没有人敢再问他什么。 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 耶稣在殿里教训人，就问他们说：“文士怎么说，基督是大卫的子孙呢？ And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 大卫被圣灵感动，说：‘主对我主说，你坐在我的右边，等我使你仇敌作你的脚凳。’ For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 大卫既自己称他为主，他怎么又是大卫的子孙呢？”众人都喜欢听他。 David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 耶稣在教训之间，说：“你们要防备文士，他们好穿长衣游行，喜爱人在街市上问他们的安； And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 又喜爱会堂里的高位，筵席上的首座。 And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 他们侵吞寡妇的家产，假意作很长的祷告。这些人要受更重的刑罚。” Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 耶稣对银库坐着，看众人怎样投钱入库。有好些财主往里投了若干的钱。 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 有一个穷寡妇来，往里投了两个小钱，就是一个大钱。 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 耶稣叫门徒来，说：“我实在告诉你们，这穷寡妇投入库里的，比众人所投的更多。 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 因为他们都是自己有余，拿出来投在里头；但这寡妇是自己不足，把她一切养生的都投上了。” For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor41_13">马可福音 13</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶稣从殿里出来的时候，有一个门徒对他说：“夫子，请看，这是何等的石头！何等的殿宇！” And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 耶稣对他说：“你看见这大殿宇吗？将来在这里没有一块石头留在石头上，不被拆毁了。” And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 耶稣在橄榄山上对圣殿而坐，彼得、雅各、约翰和安得烈，暗暗地问他说： And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: “请告诉我们，什么时候有这些事呢？这一切事将成的时候，有什么预兆呢？” Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 耶稣说：“你们要谨慎，免得有人迷惑你们。 And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 将来有好些人冒我的名来，说：‘我是基督’，并且要迷惑许多人。 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 你们听见打仗和打仗的风声，不要惊慌。这些事是必须有的，只是末期还没有到。 And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 民要攻打民，国要攻打国，多处必有地震、饥荒，这都是灾难的起头(“灾难”原文作“生产之难”)。 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 但你们要谨慎，因为人要把你们交给公会，并且你们在会堂里要受鞭打；又为我的缘故，站在诸侯与君王面前，对他们作见证。 But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 然而，福音必须先传给万民。 And the gospel must first be published among all nations.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 人把你们拉去交官的时候，不要预先思虑说什么；到那时候，赐给你们什么话，你们就说什么；因为说话的不是你们，乃是圣灵。 But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 弟兄要把弟兄，父亲要把儿子，送到死地；儿女要起来与父母为敌，害死他们。 Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 并且你们要为我的名，被众人恨恶；惟有忍耐到底的必然得救。 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: “你们看见那行毁坏可憎的，站在不当站的地方(读这经的人须要会意)。那时，在犹太的，应当逃到山上； But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 在房上的，不要下来，也不要进去拿家里的东西； And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 在田里的，也不要回去取衣裳。 And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 当那些日子，怀孕的和奶孩子的有祸了！ But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 若不是主减少那日子，凡有血气的，总没有一个得救的；只是为主的选民，他将那日子减少了。 And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 那时若有人对你们说：‘看哪！基督在这里。’或说：‘基督在那里。’你们不要信。 And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 因为假基督、假先知将要起来，显神迹奇事；倘若能行，就把选民迷惑了。 For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 他要差遣天使，把他的选民，从四方，从地极直到天边，都招聚了来(“方”原文作“风”)。 And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 过两天是逾越节，又是除酵节。祭司长和文士想法子怎么用诡计捉拿耶稣，杀他； After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 只是说：“当节的日子不可，恐怕百姓生乱。” But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 耶稣在伯大尼长大麻风的西门家里坐席的时候，有一个女人拿着一玉瓶至贵的真哪哒香膏来，打破玉瓶，把膏浇在耶稣的头上。 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 有几个人心中很不喜悦，说：“何用这样枉费香膏呢？ And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 这香膏可以卖三十多两银子周济穷人。”他们就向那女人生气。 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 耶稣说：“由她吧！为什么难为她呢？她在我身上作的是一件美事。 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 因为常有穷人和你们同在，要向他们行善，随时都可以；只是你们不常有我。 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 她所作的，是尽她所能的；她是为我安葬的事，把香膏预先浇在我身上。 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 我实在告诉你们，普天之下，无论在什么地方传这福音，也要述说这女人所作的，以为记念。” Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 十二门徒之中，有一个加略人犹大去见祭司长，要把耶稣交给他们。 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 他们听见就欢喜，又应许给他银子；他就寻思如何得便把耶稣交给他们。 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 除酵节的第一天，就是宰逾越羊羔的那一天，门徒对耶稣说：“你吃逾越节的筵席，要我们往哪里去预备呢？” And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 耶稣就打发两个门徒，对他们说：“你们进城去，必有人拿着一瓶水迎面而来，你们就跟着他。 And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他进哪家去，你们就对那家的主人说：‘夫子说：客房在哪里？我与门徒好在那里吃逾越节的筵席。’ And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 他必指给你们摆设整齐的一间大楼，你们就在那里为我们预备。” And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 门徒出去，进了城，所遇见的，正如耶稣所说的。他们就预备了逾越节的筵席。 And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 到了晚上，耶稣和十二个门徒都来了。 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 他们坐席正吃的时候，耶稣说：“我实在告诉你们，你们中间有一个与我同吃的人要卖我了。” And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他们就忧愁起来，一个一个地问他说：“是我吗？” And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 耶稣对他们说：“是十二个门徒中，同我蘸手在盘子里的那个人。 And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 人子必要去世，正如经上指着他所写的；但卖人子的人有祸了！那人不生在世上倒好。” The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 他们吃的时候，耶稣拿起饼来，祝了福，就掰开，递给他们说：“你们拿着吃，这是我的身体。” And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 又拿起杯来，祝谢了，递给他们；他们都喝了。 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 耶稣说：“这是我立约的血，为多人流出来的。 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 我实在告诉你们，我不再喝这葡萄汁，直到我在　神的国里喝新的那日子。” Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 他们唱了诗，就出来，往橄榄山去。 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 耶稣对他们说：“你们都要跌倒了，因为经上记着说：‘我要击打牧人，羊就分散了。’ And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 但我复活以后，要在你们以先往加利利去。” But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 彼得说：“众人虽然跌倒，我总不能。” But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 耶稣对他说：“我实在告诉你，就在今天夜里，鸡叫两遍以先，你要三次不认我。” And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 彼得却极力地说：“我就是必须和你同死，也总不能不认你。”众门徒都是这样说。 But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 他们来到一个地方，名叫客西马尼。耶稣对门徒说：“你们坐在这里，等我祷告。” And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 于是带着彼得、雅各、约翰同去，就惊恐起来，极其难过； And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 对他们说：“我心里甚是忧伤，几乎要死；你们在这里等候警醒。” And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 他就稍往前走，俯伏在地，祷告说：“倘若可行，便叫那时候过去。” And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 他说：“阿爸，父啊！在你凡事都能；求你将这杯撤去；然而不要从我的意思，只要从你的意思。” And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 耶稣回来，见他们睡着了，就对彼得说：“西门，你睡觉吗？不能警醒片时吗？ And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 总要警醒祷告，免得入了迷惑；你们心灵固然愿意，肉体却软弱了。” Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 耶稣又去祷告，说的话还是与先前一样； And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 又来，见他们睡着了，因为他们的眼睛甚是困倦，他们也不知道怎么回答。 And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 第三次来，对他们说：“现在你们仍然睡觉安歇吧(“吧”或作“吗”)！够了，时候到了。看哪！人子被卖在罪人手里了。 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 起来！我们走吧。看哪！那卖我的人近了。” Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 说话之间，忽然那十二个门徒里的犹大来了，并有许多人带着刀棒，从祭司长和文士并长老那里与他同来。 And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 卖耶稣的人曾给他们一个暗号，说：“我与谁亲嘴，谁就是他。你们把他拿住，牢牢靠靠地带去。” And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 犹大来了，随即到耶稣跟前说：“拉比，”便与他亲嘴。 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 他们就下手拿住他。 And they laid their hands on him, and took him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 旁边站着的人，有一个拔出刀来，将大祭司的仆人砍了一刀，削掉了他一个耳朵。 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 耶稣对他们说：“你们带着刀棒出来拿我，如同拿强盗吗？ And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 我天天教训人，同你们在殿里，你们并没有拿我；但这事成就，为要应验经上的话。” I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 门徒都离开他逃走了。 And they all forsook him, and fled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: 有一个少年人，赤身披着一块麻布，跟随耶稣，众人就捉拿他。 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">52: 他却丢了麻布，赤身逃走了。 And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">53: 他们把耶稣带到大祭司那里，又有众祭司长和长老并文士都来和大祭司一同聚集。 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">54: 彼得远远地跟着耶稣，一直进入大祭司的院里，和差役一同坐在火光里烤火。 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">55: 祭司长和全公会寻找见证控告耶稣，要治死他，却寻不着。 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">56: 因为有好些人作假见证告他，只是他们的见证各不相合。 For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">57: 又有几个人站起来，作假见证告他说： And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">58: “我们听见他说：‘我要拆毁这人手所造的殿，三日内就另造一座不是人手所造的。’” We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">59: 他们就是这么作见证，也是各不相合。 But neither so did their witness agree together.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">60: 大祭司起来站在中间，问耶稣说：“你什么都不回答吗？这些人作见证告你的是什么呢？” And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">61: 耶稣却不言语，一句也不回答。大祭司又问他说：“你是那当称颂者的儿子基督不是？” But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">62: 耶稣说：“我是。你们必看见人子，坐在那权能者的右边，驾着天上的云降临。” And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">63: 大祭司就撕开衣服，说：“我们何必再用见证人呢？ Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">64: 你们已经听见他这僭妄的话了。你们的意见如何？”他们都定他该死的罪。 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">65: 就有人吐唾沫在他脸上，又蒙着他的脸，用拳头打他，对他说：“你说预言吧！”差役接过他来，用手掌打他。 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">66: 彼得在下边院子里；来了大祭司的一个使女， And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">67: 见彼得烤火，就看着他，说：“你素来也是同拿撒勒人耶稣一伙的。” And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">68: 彼得却不承认，说：“我不知道，也不明白你说的是什么。”于是出来，到了前院，鸡就叫了。 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">69: 那使女看见他，又对旁边站着的人说：“这也是他们一党的。” And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">70: 彼得又不承认。过了不多的时候，旁边站着的人又对彼得说：“你真是他们一党的！因为你是加利利人。” And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">71: 彼得就发咒起誓地说：“我不认得你们说的这个人。” But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">72: 立时鸡叫了第二遍。彼得想起耶稣对他所说的话：“鸡叫两遍以先，你要三次不认我。”思想起来，就哭了。 And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor41_15">马可福音 15</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 一到早晨，祭司长和长老、文士、全公会的人大家商议，就把耶稣捆绑解去，交给彼拉多。 And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 彼拉多问他说：“你是犹太人的王吗？”耶稣回答说：“你说的是。” And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 祭司长告他许多的事。 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 彼拉多又问他说：“你看，他们告你这么多的事，你什么都不回答吗？” And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 耶稣仍不回答，以致彼拉多觉得希奇。 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 每逢这节期，巡抚照众人所求的，释放一个囚犯给他们。 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 有一个人名叫巴拉巴，和作乱的人一同捆绑。他们作乱的时候，曾杀过人。 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 众人上去求巡抚，照常例给他们办。 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 彼拉多说：“你们要我释放犹太人的王给你们吗？” But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 他原晓得，祭司长是因为嫉妒才把耶稣解了来。 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 只是祭司长挑唆众人，宁可释放巴拉巴给他们。 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 彼拉多又说：“那么样，你们所称为犹太人的王，我怎么办他呢？” And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他们又喊着说：“把他钉十字架！” And they cried out again, Crucify him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 彼拉多说：“为什么呢？他作了什么恶事呢？”他们便极力地喊着说：“把他钉十字架！” Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 彼拉多要叫众人喜悦，就释放巴拉巴给他们，将耶稣鞭打了，交给人钉十字架。 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 兵丁把耶稣带进衙门院里，叫齐了全营的兵。 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 他们给他穿上紫袍，又用荆棘编作冠冕给他戴上， And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 就庆贺他说：“恭喜，犹太人的王啊！” And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 又拿一根苇子打他的头，吐唾沫在他脸上，屈膝拜他。 And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 戏弄完了，就给他脱了紫袍，仍穿上他自己的衣服，带他出去，要钉十字架。 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 有一个古利奈人西门，就是亚历山大和鲁孚的父亲，从乡下来，经过那地方，他们就勉强他同去，好背着耶稣的十字架。 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 他们带耶稣到了各各他地方(各各他翻出来，就是髑髅地)； And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 拿没药调和的酒给耶稣，他却不受。 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 于是将他钉在十字架上，拈阄分他的衣服，看是谁得什么。 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 钉他在十字架上是巳初的时候。 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 在上面有他的罪状，写的是：“犹太人的王。” And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 他们又把两个强盗和他同钉十字架，一个在右边，一个在左边(有古卷在此有 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 这就应了经上的话说：“他被列在罪犯之中。”)。 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 从那里经过的人辱骂他，摇着头，说：“咳！你这拆毁圣殿，三日又建造起来的， And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 可以救自己，从十字架上下来吧。” Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 祭司长和文士也是这样戏弄他，彼此说：“他救了别人，不能救自己。 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 以色列的王基督，现在可以从十字架上下来，叫我们看见，就信了。”那和他同钉的人也是讥诮他。 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 从午正到申初，遍地都黑暗了。 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 申初的时候，耶稣大声喊着说：“以罗伊！以罗伊！拉马撒巴各大尼？”(翻出来就是：我的　神！我的　神！为什么离弃我？) And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 旁边站着的人，有的听见就说：“看哪，他叫以利亚呢！” And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 有一个人跑去，把海绒蘸满了醋，绑在苇子上，送给他喝，说：“且等着，看以利亚来不来把他取下。” And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 耶稣大声喊叫，气就断了。 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 殿里的幔子从上到下裂为两半。 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 对面站着的百夫长看见耶稣这样喊叫断气(有古卷无“喊叫”二字)，就说：“这人真是　神的儿子！” And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 还有些妇女远远地观看；内中有抹大拉的马利亚，又有小雅各和约西的母亲马利亚，并有撒罗米， There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 就是耶稣在加利利的时候，跟随他，服事他的那些人，还有同耶稣上耶路撒冷的好些妇女在那里观看。 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 到了晚上，因为这是预备日，就是安息日的前一日， And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 有亚利马太的约瑟前来，他是尊贵的议士，也是等候　神国的。他放胆进去见彼拉多，求耶稣的身体； Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 彼拉多诧异耶稣已经死了，便叫百夫长来，问他耶稣死了久不久。 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 既从百夫长得知实情，就把耶稣的尸首赐给约瑟。 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 约瑟买了细麻布，把耶稣取下来，用细麻布裹好，安放在磐石中凿出来的坟墓里，又滚过一块石头来挡住墓门。 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 抹大拉的马利亚和约西的母亲马利亚都看见安放他的地方。 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor41_16">马可福音 16</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 过了安息日，抹大拉的马利亚和雅各的母亲马利亚，并撒罗米，买了香膏，要去膏耶稣的身体。 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 七日的第一日清早，出太阳的时候，她们来到坟墓那里， And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 彼此说：“谁给我们把石头从墓门滚开呢？” And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 那石头原来很大，她们抬头一看，却见石头已经滚开了。 And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 她们进了坟墓，看见一个少年人坐在右边，穿着白袍，就甚惊恐。 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 那少年人对她们说：“不要惊恐！你们寻找那钉十字架的拿撒勒人耶稣；他已经复活了，不在这里。请看安放他的地方。 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 你们可以去告诉他的门徒和彼得说：‘他在你们以先往加利利去。在那里你们要见他，正如他从前所告诉你们的。’” But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 她们就出来，从坟墓那里逃跑。又发抖，又惊奇，什么也不告诉人，因为她们害怕。 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 在七日的第一日清早，耶稣复活了，就先向抹大拉的马利亚显现；耶稣从她身上曾赶出七个鬼。 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 她去告诉那向来跟随耶稣的人；那时他们正哀恸哭泣。 And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 他们听见耶稣活了，被马利亚看见，却是不信。 And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 这事以后，门徒中间有两个人往乡下去。走路的时候，耶稣变了形象，向他们显现。 After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他们就去告诉其余的门徒；其余的门徒也是不信。 And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 后来十一个门徒坐席的时候，耶稣向他们显现，责备他们不信，心里刚硬，因为他们不信那些在他复活以后看见他的人。 Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 他又对他们说：“你们往普天下去，传福音给万民听(“万民”原文作“凡受造的”)。 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 信而受洗的必然得救，不信的必被定罪。 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 信的人必有神迹随着他们，就是奉我的名赶鬼，说新方言； And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 手能拿蛇；若喝了什么毒物，也必不受害；手按病人，病人就必好了。” They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 主耶稣和他们说完了话，后来被接到天上，坐在　神的右边。 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 门徒出去，到处宣传福音。主和他们同工，用神迹随着，证实所传的道。阿们。 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.</p>
