And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 大卫又问他说：“事情怎样？请你告诉我。”他回答说：“百姓从阵上逃跑，也有许多人仆倒死亡，扫罗和他儿子约拿单也死了！” And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 大卫问报信的少年人说：“你怎么知道扫罗和他儿子约拿单死了呢？” And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 报信的少年人说：“我偶然到基利波山，看见扫罗伏在自己枪上，有战车、马兵，紧紧地追他。 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 他回头看见我，就呼叫我，我说：‘我在这里。’ And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 他问我说：‘你是什么人？’我说：‘我是亚玛力人。’ And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他说：‘请你来将我杀死，因为痛苦抓住我，我的生命尚存。’ He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 我准知他仆倒必不能活，就去将他杀死，把他头上的冠冕，臂上的镯子，拿到我主这里。” So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 大卫就撕裂衣服，跟随他的人也是如此。 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 而且悲哀哭号，禁食到晚上，是因扫罗和他儿子约拿单，并耶和华的民以色列家的人，倒在刀下。 And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 大卫问报信的少年人说：“你是哪里的人？”他说：“我是亚玛力客人的儿子。” And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 大卫说：“你伸手杀害耶和华的受膏者，怎么不畏惧呢？” And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 大卫叫了一个少年人来，说：“你去杀他吧！” And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 大卫对他说：“你流人血的罪，归到自己的头上，因为你亲口作见证说：‘我杀了耶和华的受膏者。’”少年人就把他杀了。 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 大卫作哀歌，吊扫罗和他儿子约拿单。 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 且吩咐将这歌教导犹大人。这歌名叫弓歌，写在雅煞珥书上。 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 歌中说：以色列啊！你尊荣者在山上被杀！大英雄何竟死亡！ The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 不要在迦特报告；不要在亚实基伦街上传扬。免得非利士的女子欢乐，免得未受割礼之人的女子矜夸。 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 基利波山哪！愿你那里没有雨露；愿你田地无土产可作供物。因为英雄的盾牌，在那里被污丢弃；扫罗的盾牌，仿佛未曾抹油。 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 约拿单的弓箭，非流敌人的血不退缩；扫罗的刀剑，非剖勇士的油不收回。 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 扫罗和约拿单，活时相悦相爱，死时也不分离。他们比鹰更快，比狮子还强。 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 以色列的女子啊！当为扫罗哭号。他曾使你们穿朱红色的美衣，使你们衣服有黄金的妆饰。 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 英雄何竟在阵上仆倒！约拿单何竟在山上被杀！ How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 我兄约拿单哪！我为你悲伤！我甚喜悦你！你向我发的爱情奇妙非常，过于妇女的爱情。 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 英雄何竟仆倒！战具何竟灭没！ How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor10_2">撒母耳记下 2</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 此后，大卫问耶和华说：“我上犹大的一个城去可以吗？”耶和华说：“可以。”大卫说：“我上哪一个城去呢？”耶和华说：“上希伯仑去。” And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 于是大卫和他的两个妻：一个是耶斯列人亚希暖；一个是作过迦密人拿八妻的亚比该，都上那里去了。 So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 大卫也将跟随他的人和他们各人的眷属，一同带上去，住在希伯仑的城邑中。 And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 犹大人来到希伯仑，在那里膏大卫作犹大家的王。有人告诉大卫说：“葬埋扫罗的，是基列雅比人。” And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 大卫就差人去见基列雅比人，对他们说：“你们厚待你们的主扫罗，将他葬埋，愿耶和华赐福与你们。 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 你们既行了这事，愿耶和华以慈爱诚实待你们，我也要为此厚待你们。 And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 现在你们的主扫罗死了，犹大家已经膏我作他们的王，所以你们要刚强奋勇。” Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 扫罗的元帅尼珥的儿子押尼珥，曾将扫罗的儿子伊施波设，带过河到玛哈念， But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 立他作王治理基列、亚书利、耶斯列、以法莲、便雅悯和以色列众人。 And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 扫罗的儿子伊施波设登基的时候，年四十岁，作以色列王二年。惟独犹大家归从大卫。 Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 大卫在希伯仑作犹大家的王，共七年零六个月。 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 尼珥的儿子押尼珥，和扫罗的儿子伊施波设的仆人，从玛哈念出来，往基遍去。 And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 洗鲁雅的儿子约押和大卫的仆人也出来，在基遍池旁与他们相遇；一班坐在池这边，一班坐在池那边。 And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 押尼珥对约押说：“让少年人起来，在我们面前戏耍吧！”约押说：“可以。” And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 就按着定数起来：属扫罗儿子伊施波设的便雅悯人过去十二名；大卫的仆人也过去十二名。 Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 彼此揪头，用刀刺肋，一同仆倒；所以那地叫作希利甲哈素林，就在基遍。 And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 那日的战事凶猛，押尼珥和以色列人败在大卫的仆人面前。 And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 在那里有洗鲁雅的三个儿子；约押、亚比筛、亚撒黑。亚撒黑脚快如野鹿一般。 And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 亚撒黑追赶押尼珥，直追赶他不偏左右。 And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 押尼珥回头说：“你是亚撒黑吗？”回答说：“是”。 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 押尼珥对他说：“你或转向左，转向右，拿住一个少年人，剥去他的战衣。”亚撒黑却不肯转开不追赶他。 And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 押尼珥又对亚撒黑说：“你转开不追赶我吧！我何必杀你呢？若杀你，有什么脸见你哥哥约押呢？” And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 亚撒黑仍不肯转开，故此押尼珥就用枪鐏刺入他的肚腹，甚至枪从背后透出，亚撒黑就在那里仆倒而死。众人赶到亚撒黑仆倒而死的地方，就都站住。 Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 约押和亚比筛追赶押尼珥，日落的时候，到了通基遍旷野的路旁，基亚对面的亚玛山。 Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 便雅悯人聚集，跟随押尼珥站在一个山顶上。 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 押尼珥呼叫约押，说：“刀剑岂可永远杀人吗？你岂不知终久必有苦楚吗？你要等何时才叫百姓回去，不追赶弟兄呢？” Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 约押说：“我指着永生的　神起誓，你若不说戏耍的那句话，今日早晨百姓就回去，不追赶弟兄了。” And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 于是约押吹角，众民就站住不再追赶以色列人，也不再打仗了。 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 押尼珥和跟随他的人，整夜经过亚拉巴，过约但河，走过毕伦，到了玛哈念。 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 约押追赶押尼珥回来，聚集众民，见大卫的仆人中缺少了十九个人和亚撒黑。 And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 但大卫的仆人杀了便雅悯人，和跟随押尼珥的人，共三百六十名。 But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 众人将亚撒黑送到伯利恒，葬在他父亲的坟墓里。约押和跟随他的人，走了一夜，天亮的时候到了希伯仑。 And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor10_3">撒母耳记下 3</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 扫罗家和大卫家争战许久，大卫家日见强盛，扫罗家日见衰弱。 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 大卫在希伯仑，得了几个儿子：长子暗嫩，是耶斯列人亚希暖所生的； And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 次子基利押(“基利押”历代上三章一节作“但以利”)，是作过迦密人拿八的妻亚比该所生的；三子押沙龙，是基述王达买的女儿玛迦所生的； And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 四子亚多尼雅是哈及所生的；五子示法提雅，是亚比他所生的； And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 六子以特念是大卫的妻以格拉所生的。大卫这六个儿子，都是在希伯仑生的。 And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 扫罗家和大卫家争战的时候，押尼珥在扫罗家大有权势。 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 扫罗有一妃嫔，名叫利斯巴，是爱亚的女儿。一日，伊施波设对押尼珥说：“你为什么与我父的妃嫔同房呢？” And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 押尼珥因伊施波设的话，就甚发怒，说：“我岂是犹大的狗头呢？我恩待你父扫罗的家，和他的弟兄、朋友，不将你交在大卫手里，今日你竟为这妇人责备我吗？ Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: - So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 我若不照着耶和华起誓应许大卫的话行，废去扫罗的位，建立大卫的位，使他治理以色列和犹大，从但直到别是巴，愿　神重重地降罚与我。” To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 伊施波设惧怕押尼珥，不敢回答一句。 And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 押尼珥打发人去见大卫，替他说：“这国归谁呢？”又说：“你与我立约，我必帮助你，使以色列人都归服你。” And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 大卫说：“好！我与你立约。但有一件，你来见我面的时候，若不将扫罗的女儿米甲带来，必不得见我的面。” And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 大卫就打发人去见扫罗的儿子伊施波设，说：“你要将我的妻米甲归还我，她是我从前用一百非利士人的阳皮所聘定的。” And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 伊施波设就打发人去，将米甲从拉亿的儿子她丈夫帕铁那里接回来。 And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 米甲的丈夫跟着她，一面走一面哭，直跟到巴户琳。押尼珥说：“你回去吧！”帕铁就回去了。 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 押尼珥对以色列长老说：“从前你们愿意大卫作王治理你们， And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 现在你们可以照心愿而行。因为耶和华曾论到大卫说：‘我必借我仆人大卫的手，救我民以色列脱离非利士人，和众仇敌的手。’” Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 押尼珥也用这话，说给便雅悯人听。又到希伯仑，将以色列人和便雅悯全家一切所喜悦的事，说给大卫听。 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 押尼珥带着二十个人，来到希伯仑见大卫；大卫就为押尼珥和他带来的人设摆筵席。 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 押尼珥对大卫说：“我要起身去招聚以色列众人来见我主我王，与你立约，你就可以照着心愿作王。”于是大卫送押尼珥去，押尼珥就平平安安地去了。 And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 约押和大卫的仆人，攻击敌军，带回许多的掠物。那时押尼珥不在希伯仑大卫那里，因大卫已经送他去，他也平平安安地去了。 And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 约押和跟随他的全军到了，就有人告诉约押说：“尼珥的儿子押尼珥来见王，王送他去，他也平平安安地去了。” When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 约押去见王说：“你这是作什么呢？押尼珥来见你，你为何送他去，他就踪影不见了呢？ Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 你当晓得尼珥的儿子押尼珥来，是要诓哄你，要知道你的出入，和你一切所行的事。” Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 约押从大卫那里出来，就打发人去追赶押尼珥，在西拉井追上他，将他带回来，大卫却不知道。 And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 押尼珥回到希伯仑，约押领他到城门的瓮洞，假作要与他说机密话，就在那里刺透他的肚腹，他便死了。这是报杀他兄弟亚撒黑的仇。 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 大卫听见了，就说：“流尼珥的儿子押尼珥的血，这罪在耶和华面前必永不归我和我的国。 And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 愿流他血的罪归到约押头上，和他父的全家；又愿约押家不断有患漏症的、长大麻风的、架拐而行的、被刀杀死的、缺乏饮食的。” Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 约押和他兄弟亚比筛杀了押尼珥，是因押尼珥在基遍争战的时候，杀了他们的兄弟亚撒黑。 So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 大卫吩咐约押和跟随他的众人说：“你们当撕裂衣服，腰束麻布，在押尼珥棺前哀哭。”大卫王也跟在棺后。 And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 他们将押尼珥葬在希伯仑。王在押尼珥的墓旁放声而哭，众民也都哭了。 And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 王为押尼珥举哀，说：“押尼珥何竟象愚顽人死呢？ And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 你手未曾捆绑，脚未曾锁住；你死如人死在罪孽之辈手下一样。”于是众民又为押尼珥哀哭。 Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 日头未落的时候，众民来劝大卫吃饭，但大卫起誓说：“我若在日头未落以前吃饭，或吃别物，愿　神重重地降罚与我。” And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 众民知道了就都喜悦。凡王所行的，众民无不喜悦。 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 那日以色列众民才知道杀尼珥的儿子押尼珥，并非出于王意。 For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 王对臣仆说：“你们岂不知今日以色列人中，死了一个作元帅的大丈夫吗？ And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 我虽然受膏为王，今日还是软弱；这洗鲁雅的两个儿子比我刚强。愿耶和华照着恶人所行的恶报应他！” And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor10_4">撒母耳记下 4</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 扫罗的儿子伊施波设，听见押尼珥死在希伯仑，手就发软；以色列众人也都惊惶。 And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 扫罗的儿子伊施波设有两个军长：一名巴拿，一名利甲；是便雅悯支派，比录人临门的儿子；比录也属便雅悯。 And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 比录人早先逃到基他音，在那里寄居，直到今日。 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 扫罗的儿子约拿单，有一个儿子名叫米非波设，是瘸腿的。扫罗和约拿单死亡的消息从耶斯列传到的时候，他才五岁。他乳母抱着他逃跑。因为跑得太急，孩子掉在地上，腿就瘸了。 And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 一日，比录人临门的两个儿子，利甲和巴拿出去，约在午热的时候，到了伊施波设的家；伊施波设正睡午觉。 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他们进了房子，假作要取麦子，就刺透伊施波设的肚腹，逃跑了。 And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 他们进房子的时候，伊施波设正在卧房里躺在床上，他们将他杀死，割了他的首级，拿着首级在亚拉巴走了一夜； For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 将伊施波设的首级拿到希伯仑见大卫王，说：“王的仇敌扫罗，曾寻索王的性命。看哪！这是他儿子伊施波设的首级，耶和华今日为我主我王，在扫罗和他后裔的身上报了仇。” And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 大卫对比录人临门的儿子利甲和他兄弟巴拿说：“我指着救我性命脱离一切苦难，永生的耶和华起誓： And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 从前有人报告我说，扫罗死了，他自以为报好消息；我就拿住他，将他杀在洗革拉，这就作了他报消息的赏赐。 When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 何况恶人将义人杀在他的床上，我岂不向你们讨流他血的罪，从世上除灭你们呢？” How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 于是大卫吩咐少年人将他们杀了，砍断他们的手脚，挂在希伯仑的池旁；却将伊施波设的首级，葬在希伯仑押尼珥的坟墓里。 And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron.

Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 大卫住在保障里，给保障起名叫大卫城。大卫又从米罗以里，周围筑墙。 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 大卫日见强盛，因为耶和华万军之　神与他同在。 And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 推罗王希兰将香柏木运到大卫那里，又差遣使者和木匠、石匠，给大卫建造宫殿。 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 大卫就知道耶和华坚立他作以色列王，又为自己的民以色列使他的国兴旺。 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 大卫离开希伯仑之后，在耶路撒冷又立后妃，又生儿女。 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 在耶路撒冷所生的儿子，是沙母亚、朔罢、拿单、所罗门、 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 益辖、以利书亚、尼斐、雅非亚、 Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 以利沙玛、以利雅大、以利法列。 And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 非利士人听见人膏大卫作以色列王，非利士众人就上来寻索大卫。大卫听见，就下到保障。 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 非利士人来了，布散在利乏音谷。 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 大卫求问耶和华说：“我可以上去攻打非利士人吗？你将他们交在我手里吗？”耶和华说：“你可以上去，我必将非利士人交在你手里。” And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand?

Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 非利士人将偶像撇在那里，大卫和跟随他的人拿去了。 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 非利士人又上来，布散在利乏音谷。 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 大卫求问耶和华。耶和华说：“不要一直地上去，要转到他们后头，从桑林对面攻打他们。 And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 你听见桑树梢上有脚步的声音，就要急速前去，因为那时耶和华已经在你前头去攻打非利士人的军队。” And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 大卫就遵着耶和华所吩咐的去行，攻打非利士人，从迦巴直到基色。 And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor10_6">撒母耳记下 6</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 大卫又聚集以色列中所有挑选的人三万。 Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 大卫起身率领跟随他的众人前往，要从巴拉犹大将　神的约柜运来。这约柜就是坐在二基路伯上万军之耶和华留名的约柜。 And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 他们将　神的约柜从冈上亚比拿达的家里抬出来，放在新车上；亚比拿达的两个儿子，乌撒和亚希约赶这新车。 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他们将　神的约柜，从冈上亚比拿达家里抬出来的时候，亚希约在柜前行走。 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 大卫和以色列的全家，在耶和华面前用松木制造的各样乐器和琴、瑟、鼓、钹、锣，作乐跳舞。 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 到了拿艮的禾场，因为牛失前蹄(或作“惊跳”)，乌撒就伸手扶住　神的约柜。 And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 　神耶和华向乌撒发怒，因这错误击杀他；他就死在　神的约柜旁。 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 大卫因耶和华击杀(原文作“闯杀”)乌撒，心里愁烦，就称那地方为毗列斯乌撒，直到今日。 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 那日大卫惧怕耶和华，说：“耶和华的约柜怎可运到我这里来？” And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 于是大卫不肯将耶和华的约柜运进大卫的城，却运到迦特人俄别以东的家中。 So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 耶和华的约柜在迦特人俄别以东家中三个月；耶和华赐福给俄别以东和他的全家。 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 有人告诉大卫王说：“耶和华因为约柜，赐福给俄别以东的家，和一切属他的。”大卫就去，欢欢喜喜地将　神的约柜，从俄别以东家中抬到大卫的城里。 And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God.

And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 但亚扪人的首领对他们的主哈嫩说：“大卫差人来安慰你，你想他是尊敬你父亲吗？他差臣仆来不是详察窥探，要倾覆这城吗？” And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 哈嫩便将大卫臣仆的胡须剃去一半，又割断他们下半截的衣服，使他们露出下体，打发他们回去。 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 有人告诉大卫，他就差人去迎接他们，因为他们甚觉羞耻。告诉他们说：“可以住在耶利哥，等到胡须长起再回来。” When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 亚扪人知道大卫憎恶他们，就打发人去，招募伯利合的亚兰人和琐巴的亚兰人，步兵二万，与玛迦王的人一千，陀伯人一万二千。 And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 大卫听见了，就差派约押统带勇猛的全军出去。 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 亚扪人出来在城门前摆阵；琐巴与利合的亚兰人，陀伯人，并玛迦人，另在郊野摆阵。 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 约押看见敌人在他前后摆阵；就从以色列军中挑选精兵，使他们对着亚兰人摆阵； When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 其余的兵交与他兄弟亚比筛，对着亚扪人摆阵。 And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 约押对亚比筛说：“亚兰人若强过我，你就来帮助我；亚扪人若强过你，我就去帮助你。 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 我们都当刚强，为本国的民和　神的城邑作大丈夫，愿耶和华凭他的意旨而行。” Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 于是约押和跟随他的人，前进攻打亚兰人，亚兰人在约押面前逃跑。 And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 亚扪人见亚兰人逃跑，他们也在亚比筛面前逃跑进城。约押就离开亚扪人那里，回耶路撒冷去了。 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 亚兰人见自己被以色列人打败，就又聚集。 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 哈大底谢差遣人，将大河那边的亚兰人调来；他们到了希兰，哈大底谢的将军朔法率领他们。 And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 有人告诉大卫，他就聚集以色列众人，过约但河来到希兰。亚兰人迎着大卫摆阵，与他打仗。 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 亚兰人在以色列人面前逃跑，大卫杀了亚兰七百辆战车的人，四万马兵，又杀了亚兰的将军朔法。 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 属哈大底谢的诸王，见自己被以色列人打败，就与以色列人和好，归服他们。于是亚兰人，不敢再帮助亚扪人了。 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them.

But David tarried still at Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 一日太阳平西，大卫从床上起来，在王宫的平顶上游行，看见一个妇人沐浴，容貌甚美。 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 大卫就差人打听那妇人是谁。有人说：“她是以连的女儿，赫人乌利亚的妻拔示巴。” And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 大卫差人去，将妇人接来，那时她的月经才得洁净。她来了，大卫与她同房，她就回家去了。 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 于是她怀了孕，打发人去告诉大卫说：“我怀了孕。” And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 大卫差人到约押那里，说：“你打发赫人乌利亚到我这里来。”约押就打发乌利亚去见大卫。 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 乌利亚来了，大卫问约押好，也问兵好，又问争战的事怎样。 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 大卫对乌利亚说：“你回家去，洗洗脚吧！”乌利亚出了王宫，随后王送他一份食物。 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 乌利亚却和他主人的仆人一同睡在宫门外，没有回家去。 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 有人告诉大卫说：“乌利亚没有回家去。”大卫就问乌利亚说：“你从远路上来，为什么不回家去呢？” And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 乌利亚对大卫说：“约柜和以色列，与犹大兵，都住在棚里；我主约押和我主(或作“王”)的仆人，都在田野安营，我岂可回家吃喝，与妻子同寝呢？我敢在王面前起誓(原文作“我指着王和王的性命起誓”)：我决不行这事。” And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 大卫吩咐乌利亚说：“你今日仍住在这里，明日我打发你去。”于是乌利亚那日和次日住在耶路撒冷。 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 大卫召了乌利亚来，叫他在自己面前吃喝，使他喝醉。到了晚上，乌利亚出去与他主的仆人一同住宿，还没有回到家里去。 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 次日早晨，大卫写信与约押，交乌利亚随手带去。 And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 信内写着说：“要派乌利亚前进，到阵势极险之处，你们便退后，使他被杀。” And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 约押围城的时候，知道敌人那里有勇士，便将乌利亚派在那里。 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 城里的人出来，和约押打仗。大卫的仆人中有几个被杀的，赫人乌利亚也死了。 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 于是约押差人去将争战的一切事告诉大卫， Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 又嘱咐使者说：“你把争战的一切事对王说完了， And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 王若发怒，问你说：‘你们打仗为什么挨近城墙呢？岂不知敌人必从城上射箭吗？ And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 从前打死耶路比设(就是“耶路巴力”，见士师记九章一节)儿子亚比米勒的是谁呢？岂不是一个妇人，从城上抛下一块上磨石来，打在他身上，他就死在提备斯吗？你们为什么挨近城墙呢？’你就说：‘王的仆人赫人乌利亚也死了。’” Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 使者起身，来见大卫，照着约押所吩咐他的话，奏告大卫。 So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 使者对大卫说：“敌人强过我们，出到郊野与我们打仗，我们追杀他们，直到城门口。 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 射箭的从城上射王的仆人，射死几个，赫人乌利亚也死了。” And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 王向使者说：“你告诉约押说，不要因这事愁闷，刀剑或吞灭这人，或吞灭那人，没有一定的；你只管竭力攻城，将城倾覆。可以用这话勉励约押。” Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 乌利亚的妻听见丈夫乌利亚死了，就为他哀哭。 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 哀哭的日子过了，大卫差人将她接到宫里，她就作了大卫的妻，给大卫生了一个儿子。但大卫所行的这事，耶和华甚不喜悦。 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son.

And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 只是你行这事，叫耶和华的仇敌大得亵渎的机会，故此你所得的孩子，必定要死。” Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 拿单就回家去了。耶和华击打乌利亚妻给大卫所生的孩子，使他得重病。 And Nathan departed unto his house.

And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 大卫见臣仆彼此低声说话，就知道孩子死了。问臣仆说：“孩子死了吗？”他们说：“死了！” But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 大卫就从地上起来，沐浴，抹膏，换了衣裳，进耶和华的殿敬拜，然后回宫，吩咐人摆饭，他便吃了。 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 臣仆问他说：“你所行的是什么意思？孩子活着的时候，你禁食哭泣；孩子死了，你倒起来吃饭。” Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 大卫说：“孩子还活着，我禁食哭泣；因为我想：或者耶和华怜恤我，使孩子不死，也未可知。 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 孩子死了，我何必禁食，我岂能使他返回呢？我必往他那里去，他却不能回我这里来。” But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 大卫安慰他的妻拔示巴，与她同寝；她就生了儿子，给他起名叫所罗门。耶和华也喜爱他， And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 就借先知拿单赐他一个名字，叫耶底底亚，因为耶和华爱他。 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 约押攻取亚扪人的京城拉巴。 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 约押打发使者去见大卫说：“我攻打拉巴，取其水城。 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 现在你要聚集其余的军兵来，安营围攻这城，恐怕我取了这城，人就以我的名叫这城。” Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 于是大卫聚集众军，往拉巴去攻城，就取了这城。 And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 夺了亚扪人之王所戴的金冠冕(“王”或作“玛勒堪”玛勒堪即米勒公，又名摩洛，亚扪族之神名)，其上的金子，重一他连得，又嵌着宝石。人将这冠冕戴在大卫头上。大卫从城里夺了许多财物， And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 将城里的人，拉出来放在锯下、或铁耙下、或铁斧下、或叫他经过砖窑(或作“强他们用锯或用打粮食的铁器或用铁斧作工或使在砖窑里服役”)，大卫待亚扪各城的居民，都是如此。其后大卫和众军都回耶路撒冷去了。 And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor10_13">撒母耳记下 13</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 大卫的儿子押沙龙有一个美貌的妹子，名叫他玛。大卫的儿子暗嫩爱她。 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 暗嫩为他妹子他玛忧急成病。他玛还是处女，暗嫩以为难向她行事。 And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 暗嫩有一个朋友，名叫约拿达，是大卫长兄示米亚的儿子；这约拿达为人极其狡猾。 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他问暗嫩说：“王的儿子啊！为何一天比一天瘦弱呢？请你告诉我。”暗嫩回答说：“我爱我兄弟押沙龙的妹子他玛。” And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 约拿达说：“你不如躺在床上装病，你父亲来看你，就对他说，求父叫我妹子他玛来，在我眼前预备食物，递给我吃，使我看见，好从她手里接过来吃。” And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 于是暗嫩躺卧装病。王来看他，他对王说：“求父叫我妹子他玛来，在我眼前为我作两个饼，我好从她手里接过来吃。” So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 大卫就打发人到宫里，对他玛说：“你往你哥哥暗嫩的屋里去，为他预备食物。” Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 他玛就到她哥哥暗嫩的屋里。暗嫩正躺卧。他玛抟面、在他眼前作饼，且烤熟了。 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 在他面前，将饼从锅里倒出来，他却不肯吃，便说：“众人离开我出去吧！”众人就都离开他出去了。 And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 暗嫩对他玛说：“你把食物拿进卧房，我好从你手里接过来吃。”他玛就把所作的饼，拿进卧房，到她哥哥暗嫩那里。 And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 拿着饼上前给他吃，他便拉住他玛说：“我妹妹，你来与我同寝。” And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他玛说：“我哥哥，不要玷辱我。以色列人中不当这样行，你不要作这丑事。 And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 你玷辱了我，我何以掩盖我的羞耻呢？你在以色列中也成了愚妄人。你可以求王，他必不禁止我归你。” And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 但暗嫩不肯听她的话，因比她力大，就玷辱她，与她同寝。 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 随后，暗嫩极其恨她，那恨她的心，比先前爱她的心更甚！对她说：“你起来去吧！” Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 他玛说：“不要这样！你赶出我去的这罪，比你才行的更重！”但暗嫩不肯听她的话。 And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 就叫伺候自己的仆人来，说：“将这个女子赶出去！她一出去，你就关门上闩。” Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 那时他玛穿着彩衣，因为没有出嫁的公主都是这样穿。暗嫩的仆人就把她赶出去，关门上闩。 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他玛把灰尘撒在头上，撕裂所穿的彩衣，以手抱头，一面行走，一面哭喊。 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 她胞兄押沙龙问她说：“莫非你哥哥暗嫩与你亲近了吗？我妹妹，暂且不要作声，他是你的哥哥，不要将这事放在心上。”他玛就孤孤单单地住在她胞兄押沙龙家里。 And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 大卫王听见这事，就甚发怒。 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 押沙龙并不和他哥哥暗嫩说好说歹，因为暗嫩玷辱他妹妹他玛，所以押沙龙恨恶他。 And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 过了二年，在靠近以法莲的巴力夏琐，有人为押沙龙剪羊毛；押沙龙请王的众子与他同去。 And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 押沙龙来见王说：“现在有人为仆人剪羊毛，请王和王的臣仆与仆人同去。” And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 王对押沙龙说：“我儿，我们不必都去，恐怕使你耗费太多。”押沙龙再三请王，王仍是不肯去，只为他祝福。 And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 押沙龙说：“王若不去，求王许我哥哥暗嫩同去。”王说：“何必要他去呢？” Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 押沙龙再三求王，王就许暗嫩和王的众子，与他同去。 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 押沙龙吩咐仆人说：“你们注意，看暗嫩饮酒畅快的时候，我对你们说，杀暗嫩，你们便杀他，不要惧怕。这不是我吩咐你们的吗？你们只管壮胆奋勇！” Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 押沙龙的仆人就照押沙龙所吩咐的，向暗嫩行了。王的众子都起来，各人骑上骡子，逃跑了。 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 他们还在路上，有风声传到大卫那里，说：“押沙龙将王的众子都杀了，没有留下一个。” And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 王就起来，撕裂衣服，躺在地上；王的臣仆，也都撕裂衣服，站在旁边。 Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 大卫的长兄，示米亚的儿子约拿达说：“我主，不要以为王的众子少年人都杀了，只有暗嫩一个人死了。自从暗嫩玷辱押沙龙妹子他玛的那日，押沙龙就定意杀暗嫩了。 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 现在，我主我王，不要把这事放在心上，以为王的众子都死了，只有暗嫩一个人死了。” Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 押沙龙逃跑了。守望的少年人举目观看，见有许多人从山坡的路上来。 But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 约拿达对王说：“看哪！王的众子都来了，果然与你仆人所说的相合。” And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 话才说完，王的众子都到了，放声大哭；王和臣仆，也都哭得甚恸。 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 押沙龙逃到基述王亚米忽的儿子达买那里去了。大卫天天为他儿子悲哀。 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 押沙龙逃到基述，在那里住了三年。 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 暗嫩死了以后，大卫王得了安慰，心里切切想念押沙龙。 And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor10_14">撒母耳记下 14</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 洗鲁雅的儿子约押，知道王心里想念押沙龙， Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 就打发人往提哥亚去，从那里叫了一个聪明的妇人来，对她说：“请你假装居丧的，穿上孝衣，不要用膏抹身，要装作为死者许久悲哀的妇人。 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 进去见王，对王如此如此说。”于是约押将当说的话教导了妇人。 And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 提哥亚妇人到王面前，伏地叩拜，说：“王啊！求你拯救。” And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 王问她说：“你有什么事呢？”回答说：“婢女实在是寡妇，我丈夫死了。 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 我有两个儿子，一日在田间争斗，没有人解劝，这个就打死那个。 And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 现在全家的人都起来攻击婢女，说：‘你将那打死兄弟的交出来，我们好治死他，偿他打死兄弟的命，灭绝那承受家业的。’这样，他们要将我剩下的炭火灭尽，不与我丈夫留名留后在世上。” And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 王对妇人说：“你回家去吧！我必为你下令。” And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 提哥亚妇人又对王说：“我主我王，愿这罪归我和我父家，与王和王的位无干。” And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 王说：“凡难为你的，你就带他到我这里来，他必不再搅扰你。” And the king said, Whosoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 妇人说：“愿王记念耶和华你的　神，不许报血仇的人施行灭绝，恐怕他们灭绝我的儿子。”王说：“我指着永生的耶和华起誓，你的儿子连一根头发也不至落在地上。” Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 妇人说：“求我主我王，容婢女再说一句话。”王说：“你说吧！” Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 妇人说：“王为何也起意要害　神的民呢？王不使那逃亡的人回来；王的这话，就是自证己错了！ And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 我们都是必死的，如同水泼在地上，不能收回。　神并不夺取人的性命，乃设法使逃亡的人不至成为赶出回不来的。 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 我来将这话告诉我主我王，是因百姓使我惧怕。婢女想，不如将这话告诉王，或者王成就婢女所求的。 Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 人要将我和我儿子，从　神的地业上一同除灭，王必应允救我脱离他的手。 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 婢女又想，我主我王的话必安慰我，因为我主我王能辨别是非，如同　神的使者一样。惟愿耶和华你的　神与你同在。” Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 王对妇人说：“我要问你一句话，你一点不要瞒我。”妇人说：“愿我主我王说。” Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 王说：“你这些话莫非是约押的主意吗？”妇人说：“我敢在我主我王面前起誓，王的话正对，不偏左右，是王的仆人约押吩咐我的，这些话是他教导我的。 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 王的仆人约押如此行，为要挽回这事。我主的智慧，却如　神使者的智慧，能知世上一切事。” To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 王对约押说：“我应允你这事，你可以去，把那少年人押沙龙带回来。” And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 约押就面伏于地叩拜，祝谢于王。又说：“王既应允仆人所求的，仆人今日知道在我主我王眼前蒙恩了。” And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 于是约押起身往基述去，将押沙龙带回耶路撒冷。 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 王说：“使他回自己家里去，不要见我的面。”押沙龙就回自己家里去，没有见王的面。 And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 以色列全地之中，无人象押沙龙那样俊美，得人的称赞：从脚底到头顶，毫无瑕疵。 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 他的头发甚重，每到年底剪发一次，所剪下来的，按王的平称一称，重二百舍客勒。 And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 押沙龙生了三个儿子，一个女儿。女儿名叫他玛，是个容貌俊美的女子。 And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 押沙龙住在耶路撒冷足有二年，没有见王的面。 So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 押沙龙打发人去叫约押来，要托他去见王，约押却不肯来。第二次打发人去叫他，他仍不肯来。 Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 所以押沙龙对仆人说：“你们看，约押有一块田，与我的田相近，其中有大麦，你们去放火烧了。”押沙龙的仆人就去放火烧了那田。 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 于是约押起来，到了押沙龙家里，问他说：“你的仆人为何放火烧了我的田呢？” Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 押沙龙回答约押说：“我打发人去请你来，好托你去见王，替我说，我为何从基述回来呢？不如仍在那里。现在要许我见王的面，我若有罪，任凭王杀我就是了。” And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 于是约押去见王，将这话奏告王，王便叫押沙龙来。押沙龙来见王，在王面前俯伏于地，王就与押沙龙亲嘴。 So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor10_15">撒母耳记下 15</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 此后，押沙龙为自己预备车马，又派五十人在他前头奔走。 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 押沙龙常常早晨起来，站在城门的道旁，凡有争讼要去求王判断的，押沙龙就叫他过来，问他说：“你是哪一城的人？”回答说：“仆人是以色列某支派的人。” And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 押沙龙对他说：“你的事有情有理，无奈王没有委人听你伸诉。” And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 押沙龙又说：“恨不得我作国中的士师！凡有争讼求审判的，到我这里来，我必秉公判断。” Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 若有人近前来要拜押沙龙，押沙龙就伸手拉住他，与他亲嘴。 And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 以色列人中，凡去见王求判断的，押沙龙都是如此待他们。这样，押沙龙暗中得了以色列人的心。 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 满了四十年(有作“四年”的)，押沙龙对王说：“求你准我往希伯仑去，还我向耶和华所许的愿。 And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 因为仆人住在亚兰的基述，曾许愿说，耶和华若使我再回耶路撒冷，我必事奉他。” For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 王说：“你平平安安地去吧！”押沙龙就起身，往希伯仑去了。 And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 押沙龙打发探子走遍以色列各支派，说：“你们一听见角声，就说，押沙龙在希伯仑作王了。” But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 押沙龙在耶路撒冷请了二百人与他同去，都是诚诚实实去的，并不知道其中的真情。 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 押沙龙献祭的时候，打发人去将大卫的谋士基罗人亚希多弗，从他本城请了来。于是叛逆的势派甚大，因为随从押沙龙的人民，日渐增多。 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 有人报告大卫说：“以色列人的心，都归向押沙龙了！” And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 大卫就对耶路撒冷跟随他的臣仆说：“我们要起来逃走，不然都不能躲避押沙龙了；要速速地去，恐怕他忽然来到，加害于我们，用刀杀尽合城的人！” And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 王的臣仆对王说：“我主我王所定的，仆人都愿遵行。” And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 于是王带着全家的人出去了，但留下十个妃嫔看守宫殿。 And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 王出去，众民都跟随他，到伯墨哈，就住下了。 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 王的臣仆都在他面前过去。基利提人，比利提人，就是从迦特跟随王来的六百人，也都在他面前过去。 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 王对迦特人以太说：“你是外邦逃来的人，为什么与我们同去呢？你可以回去，与新王同住，或者回你本地去吧！ Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 你来的日子不多，我今日怎好叫你与我们一同飘流，没有一定的住处呢？你不如带你的弟兄回去吧！愿耶和华用慈爱诚实待你。” Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 以太对王说：“我指着永生的耶和华起誓，又敢在王面前起誓；无论生死，王在哪里，仆人也必在哪里。” And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 大卫对以太说：“你前去过河吧！”于是迦特人以太带着跟随他的人和所有的妇人孩子，就都过去了。 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 本地的人，都放声大哭，众民尽都过去，王也过了汲沦溪。众民往旷野去了。 And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 撒督和抬　神约柜的利未人，也一同来了，将　神的约柜放下。亚比亚他上来，等着众民从城里出来过去。 And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 王对撒督说：“你将　神的约柜抬回城去。我若在耶和华眼前蒙恩，他必使我回来，再见约柜和他的居所。 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 倘若他说，我不喜悦你。看哪！我在这里，愿他凭自己的意旨待我！” But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 王又对祭司撒督说：“你不是先见吗？你可以安然回城；你儿子亚希玛斯和亚比亚他的儿子约拿单，都可以与你同去。 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 我在旷野的渡口那里等你们报信给我。” See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 于是撒督和亚比亚他将　神的约柜抬回耶路撒冷，他们就住在那里。 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 大卫蒙头赤脚上橄榄山，一面上，一面哭。跟随他的人，也都蒙头哭着上去。 And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 有人告诉大卫说：“亚希多弗也在叛党之中，随从押沙龙。”大卫祷告说：“耶和华啊！求你使亚希多弗的计谋变为愚拙。” And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 大卫到了山顶，敬拜　神的地方，见亚基人户筛，衣服撕裂，头蒙灰尘，来迎接他。 And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 大卫对他说：“你若与我同去，必累赘我； Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 你若回城去，对押沙龙说：‘王啊！我愿作你的仆人；我向来作你父亲的仆人，现在我也照样作你的仆人。’这样，你就可以为我破坏亚希多弗的计谋。 But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 祭司撒督和亚比亚他，岂不都在那里吗？你在王宫里听见什么，就要告诉祭司撒督和亚比亚他。 And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 撒督的儿子亚希玛斯，亚比亚他的儿子约拿单，也都在那里。凡你们所听见的，可以托这二人来报告我。” Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 于是大卫的朋友户筛进了城，押沙龙也进了耶路撒冷。 So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor10_16">撒母耳记下 16</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 大卫刚过山顶，见米非波设的仆人洗巴，拉着备好了的两匹驴，驴上驮着二百面饼，一百葡萄饼，一百个夏天的果饼，一皮袋酒来迎接他。 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 王问洗巴说：“你带这些来是什么意思呢？”洗巴说：“驴，是给王的家眷骑的；面饼和夏天的果饼，是给少年人吃的；酒，是给在旷野疲乏人喝的。” And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 王问说：“你主人的儿子在哪里呢？”洗巴回答王说：“他仍在耶路撒冷。因他说，以色列人今日必将我父的国归还我。” And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 王对洗巴说：“凡属米非波设的都归你了！”洗巴说：“我叩拜我主我王，愿我在你眼前蒙恩。” Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 大卫王到了巴户琳，见有一个人出来，是扫罗族基拉的儿子，名叫示每。他一面走，一面咒骂， And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 又拿石头砍大卫王和王的臣仆；众民和勇士，都在王的左右。 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 示每咒骂说：“你这流人血的坏人哪！去吧去吧！ And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 你流扫罗全家的血，接续他作王；耶和华把这罪归在你身上，将这国交给你儿子押沙龙。现在你自取其祸，因为你是流人血的人。” The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 洗鲁雅的儿子亚比筛对王说：“这死狗岂可咒骂我主我王呢？求你容我过去，割下他的头来。” Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 王说：“洗鲁雅的儿子，我与你们有何关涉呢？他咒骂，是因耶和华吩咐他说，你要咒骂大卫。如此，谁敢说你为什么这样行呢？” And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 大卫又对亚比筛和众臣仆说：“我亲生的儿子，尚且寻索我的性命，何况这便雅悯人呢？由他咒骂吧！因为这是耶和华吩咐他的。 And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 或者耶和华见我遭难，为我今日被这人咒骂，就施恩与我。” It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 于是大卫和跟随他的人往前行走。示每在大卫对面山坡，一面行走，一面咒骂，又拿石头砍他，拿土扬他。 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 王和跟随他的众人，疲疲乏乏地到了一个地方，就在那里歇息歇息。 And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 押沙龙和以色列众人，来到耶路撒冷，亚希多弗也与他同来。 And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 大卫的朋友亚基人户筛，去见押沙龙，对他说：“愿王万岁！愿王万岁！” And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 押沙龙问户筛说：“这是你恩待朋友吗？为什么不与你的朋友同去呢？” And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 户筛对押沙龙说：“不然，耶和华和这民，并以色列众人所拣选的，我必归顺他，与他同住。 And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 再者，我当服事谁呢？岂不是前王的儿子吗？我怎样服事你父亲，也必照样服事你。” And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 押沙龙对亚希多弗说：“你们出个主意，我们怎样行才好？” Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 亚希多弗对押沙龙说：“你父所留下看守宫殿的妃嫔，你可以与她们亲近。以色列众人听见你父亲憎恶你，凡归顺你人的手，就更坚强。” And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 于是人为押沙龙在宫殿的平顶上，支搭帐棚。押沙龙在以色列众人眼前，与他父的妃嫔亲近。 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 那时，亚希多弗所出的主意，好象人问　神的话一样；他昔日给大卫，今日给押沙龙所出的主意，都是这样。 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor10_17">撒母耳记下 17</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 亚希多弗又对押沙龙说：“求你准我挑选一万二千人，今夜我就起身追赶大卫， Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 趁他疲乏手软，我忽然追上他，使他惊惶；跟随他的民，必都逃跑；我就单杀王一人， And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 使众民都归顺你。你所寻找的人既然死了，众民就如已经归顺你，这样，也都平安无事了。” And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 押沙龙和以色列的长老，都以这话为美。 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 押沙龙说：“要召亚基人户筛来，我们也要听他怎样说。” Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 户筛到了押沙龙面前，押沙龙向他说：“亚希多弗是如此如此说的，我们照着他的话行，可以不可以？若不可，你就说吧！” And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 户筛对押沙龙说：“亚希多弗这次所定的谋不善。” And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 户筛又说：“你知道你父亲和跟随他的人，都是勇士，现在他们心里恼怒，如同田野丢崽子的母熊一般；而且你父亲是个战士，必不和民一同住宿， For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他现今或藏在坑中，或在别处。若有人首先被杀，凡听见的必说，跟随押沙龙的民被杀了； Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 虽有人胆大如狮子，他的心也必消化；因为以色列人都知道你父亲是英雄，跟随他的人也都是勇士。 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 依我之计，不如将以色列众人，从但直到别是巴，如同海边的沙那样多，聚集到你这里来；你也亲自率领他们出战。 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 这样，我们在何处遇见他，就下到他那里，如同露水下在地上一般，连他带跟随他的人，一个也不留下。 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他若进了哪一座城，以色列众人，必带绳子去，将那城拉到河里，甚至连一块小石头都不剩下。” Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 押沙龙和以色列众人说：“亚基人户筛的计谋，比亚希多弗的计谋更好！”这是因耶和华定意破坏亚希多弗的良谋，为要降祸与押沙龙。 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 户筛对祭司撒督和亚比亚他说：“亚希多弗为押沙龙和以色列的长老所定的计谋，是如此如此；我所定的计谋，是如此如此。 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 现在你们要急速打发人去，告诉大卫说：‘今夜不可住在旷野的渡口，务要过河，免得王和跟随他的人，都被吞灭。’” Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 那时约拿单和亚希玛斯在隐罗结那里等候，不敢进城，恐怕被人看见。有一个使女出来，将这话告诉他们，他们就去报信给大卫王。 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 然而有一个童子看见他们，就去告诉押沙龙。他们急忙跑到巴户琳某人的家里，那人院中有一口井，他们就下到井里。 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 那家的妇人用盖盖上井口，又在上头铺上碎麦，事就没有泄漏。 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 押沙龙的仆人来到那家，问妇人说：“亚希玛斯和约拿单在哪里？”妇人说：“他们过了河了。”仆人找他们，找不着，就回耶路撒冷去了。 And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 他们走后，二人从井里上来，去告诉大卫王说：“亚希多弗如此如此定计害你，你们务要起来，快快过河！” And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 于是大卫和跟随他的人，都起来过约但河。到了天亮，无一人不过约但河的。 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 亚希多弗见不依从他的计谋，就备上驴，归回本城。到了家，留下遗言，便吊死了，葬在他父亲的坟墓里。 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 大卫到了玛哈念，押沙龙和跟随他的以色列人，也都过了约但河。 Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 押沙龙立亚玛撒作元帅，代替约押。亚玛撒是以实玛利人(又作“以色列人”)，以特拉的儿子。以特拉曾与拿辖的女儿亚比该亲近；这亚比该与约押的母亲洗鲁雅是姐妹。 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 押沙龙和以色列人都安营在基列地。 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 大卫到了玛哈念，亚扪族的拉巴人拿辖的儿子朔比，罗底巴人亚米利的儿子玛吉，基列的罗基琳人巴西莱， And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 带着被、褥、盆、碗、瓦器、小麦、大麦、麦面、炒谷、豆子、红豆、炒豆、 Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 蜂蜜、奶油、绵羊、奶饼，供给大卫和跟随他的人吃。他们说：“民在旷野，必饥渴困乏了。” And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor10_18">撒母耳记下 18</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 大卫数点跟随他的人，立千夫长百夫长率领他们。 And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 大卫打发军兵出战，分为三队：一队在约押手下；一队在洗鲁雅的儿子约押兄弟亚比筛手下；一队在迦特人以太手下。大卫对军兵说：“我必与你们一同出战。” And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 军兵却说：“你不可出战。若是我们逃跑，敌人必不介意；我们阵亡一半，敌人也不介意。因为你一人强似我们万人，你不如在城里预备帮助我们。” But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 王向他们说：“你们以为怎样好，我就怎样行。”于是王站在城门旁，军兵或百或千地挨次出去了。 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 王嘱咐约押、亚比筛、以太，说：“你们要为我的缘故，宽待那少年人押沙龙。”王为押沙龙嘱咐众将的话，兵都听见了。 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 兵就出到田野迎着以色列人，在以法莲树林里交战。 So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 以色列人败在大卫的仆人面前，那日阵亡的甚多，共有二万人。 Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 因为在那里四面打仗，死于树林的，比死于刀剑的更多。 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 押沙龙偶然遇见大卫的仆人。押沙龙骑着骡子，从大橡树密枝底下经过，他的头发被树枝绕住，就悬挂起来，所骑的骡子便离他去了。 And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 有个人看见，就告诉约押说：“我看见押沙龙挂在橡树上了。” And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 约押对报信的人说：“你既看见他，为什么不将他打死，落在地上呢？你若打死他，我就赏你十舍客勒银子，一条带子。” And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 那人对约押说：“我就是得你一千舍客勒银子，我也不敢伸手害王的儿子，因为我们听见王嘱咐你和亚比筛并以太说，你们要谨慎，不可害那少年人押沙龙。 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我若妄为害了他的性命，就是你自己也必与我为敌。原来无论何事，都瞒不过王。” Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 约押说：“我不能与你留连。”约押手拿三杆短枪，趁押沙龙在橡树上还活着，就刺透他的心。 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 给约押拿兵器的十个少年人围绕押沙龙，将他杀死。 And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 约押吹角，拦阻众人，他们就回来，不再追赶以色列人。 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 他们将押沙龙丢在林中一个大坑里，上头堆起一大堆石头。以色列众人都逃跑，各回各家去了。 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 押沙龙活着的时候，在王谷立了一根石柱，因他说：“我没有儿子为我留名。”他就以自己的名，称那石柱叫押沙龙柱，直到今日。 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 撒督的儿子亚希玛斯说：“容我跑去，将耶和华向仇敌给王报仇的信息报与王知。” Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 约押对他说：“你今日不可去报信，改日可以报信，因为今日王的儿子死了，所以你不可去报信。” And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 约押对古示人说：“你去将你所看见的告诉王。”古示人在约押面前下拜，就跑去了。 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 撒督的儿子亚希玛斯又对约押说：“无论怎样，求你容我随着古示人跑去。”约押说：“我儿，你报这信息，既不得赏赐，何必要跑去呢？” Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 他又说：“无论怎样，我要跑去。”约押说：“你跑去吧！”亚希玛斯就从平原往前跑，跑过古示人去了。 But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 大卫正坐在城瓮里。守望的人上城门楼的顶上，举目观看；见有一个人独自跑来。 And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 守望的人就大声告诉王。王说：“他若独自来，必是报口信的。”那人跑得渐渐近了。 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 守望的人又见一人跑来，就对守城门的人说：“又有一人独自跑来！”王说：“这也必是报信的。” And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 守望的人说：“我看前头人的跑法，好象撒督的儿子亚希玛斯的跑法一样。”王说：“他是个好人，必是报好信息。” And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 亚希玛斯向王呼叫说：“平安了！”就在王面前脸伏于地叩拜，说：“耶和华你的　神是应当称颂的，因他已将那举手攻击我主我王的人交给王了！” And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 王问说：“少年人押沙龙平安不平安？”亚希玛斯回答说：“约押打发王的仆人，那时仆人听见众民大声喧哗，却不知道是什么事。” And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 王说：“你退去，站在旁边！”他就退去，站在旁边。 And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 古示人也来到，说：“有信息报给我主我王！耶和华今日向一切兴起攻击你的人给你报仇了！” And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 王问古示人说：“少年人押沙龙平安不平安？”古示人回答说：“愿我主我王的仇敌，和一切兴起要杀害你的人，都与那少年人一样。” And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 王就心里伤恸，上城门楼去哀哭。一面走，一面说：“我儿押沙龙啊！我儿，我儿押沙龙啊！我恨不得替你死。押沙龙啊！我儿！我儿！” And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor10_19">撒母耳记下 19</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 有人告诉约押说：“王为押沙龙哭泣悲哀。” And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 众民听说王为他儿子忧愁，他们得胜的欢乐，却变成悲哀。 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 那日众民暗暗地进城，就如败阵逃跑惭愧的民一般。 And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 王蒙着脸，大声哭号，说：“我儿押沙龙啊！押沙龙，我儿，我儿啊！” But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 约押进去见王，说：“你今日使你一切仆人脸面惭愧了！他们今日救了你的性命和你儿女妻妾的性命， And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 你却爱那恨你的人，恨那爱你的人。你今日明明地不以将帅仆人为念。我今日看明：若押沙龙活着，我们都死亡，你就喜悦了。 In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 现在你当出去，安慰你仆人的心。我指着耶和华起誓，你若不出去，今夜必无一人与你同在一处；这祸患就比你从幼年到如今所遭的更甚。” Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 于是王起来，坐在城门口。众民听说王坐在城门口，就都到王面前。以色列人已经逃跑，各回各家去了。 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 以色列众支派的人纷纷议论说：“王曾救我们脱离仇敌的手，又救我们脱离非利士人的手，现在他躲避押沙龙逃走了。 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 我们膏押沙龙治理我们，他已经阵亡。现在为什么不出一言请王回来呢？” And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 大卫王差人去见祭司撒督和亚比亚他，说：“你们当向犹大长老说：‘以色列众人已经有话请王回宫，你们为什么落在他们后头呢？ And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 你们是我的弟兄，是我的骨肉，为什么在人后头请王回来呢？’ Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 也要对亚玛撒说：‘你不是我的骨肉吗？我若不立你替约押常作元帅，愿　神重重地降罚与我。’” And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 如此就挽回犹大众人的心，如同一人的心。他们便打发人去见王说：“请王和王的一切臣仆回来。” And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 王就回来，到了约但河。犹大人来到吉甲，要去迎接王，请他过约但河。 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 巴户琳的便雅悯人，基拉的儿子示每急忙与犹大人一同下去迎接大卫王。 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 跟从示每的有一千便雅悯人，还有扫罗家的仆人洗巴和他十五个儿子，二十个仆人。他们都趟过约但河迎接王。 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 有摆渡船过去，渡王的家眷，任王使用。王要过约但河的时候，基拉的儿子示每就俯伏在王面前， And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 对王说：“我主我王出耶路撒冷的时候，仆人行悖逆的事；现在求我主不要因此加罪与仆人，不要记念，也不要放在心上。 And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 仆人明知自己有罪，所以约瑟全家之中，今日我首先下来迎接我主我王。” For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 洗鲁雅的儿子亚比筛说：“示每既咒骂耶和华的受膏者，不应当治死他吗？” But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 大卫说：“洗鲁雅的儿子，我与你们有何关涉，使你们今日与我反对呢？今日在以色列中岂可治死人呢？我岂不知今日我作以色列的王吗？” And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 于是王对示每说：“你必不死。”王就向他起誓。 Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 扫罗的孙子米非波设也下去迎接王。他自从王去的日子，直到王平平安安地回来，没有修脚，没有剃胡须，也没有洗衣服。 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 他来到耶路撒冷迎接王的时候，王问他说：“米非波设，你为什么没有与我同去呢？” And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 他回答说：“我主我王，仆人是瘸腿的。那日我想要备驴骑上，与王同去，无奈我的仆人欺哄了我； And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 又在我主我王面前谗毁我。然而我主我王如同　神的使者一般，你看怎样好，就怎样行吧！ And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 因为我祖全家的人，在我主我王面前，都算为死人；王却使仆人在王的席上，同人吃饭。我现在向王还能辨理诉冤吗？” For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 王对他说：“你何必再提你的事呢？我说，你与洗巴均分地土。” And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 米非波设对王说：“我主我王既平平安安地回宫，就任凭洗巴都取了也可以。” And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 基列人巴西莱从罗基琳下来，要送王过约但河，就与王一同过了约但河。 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 巴西莱年纪老迈，已经八十岁了。王住在玛哈念的时候，他就拿食物来供给王；他原是大富户。 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 王对巴西莱说：“你与我同去，我要在耶路撒冷那里养你的老。” And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 巴西莱对王说：“我在世的年日还能有多少，使我与王同上耶路撒冷呢？ And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 仆人现在八十岁了，还能尝出饮食的滋味，辨别美恶吗？还能听男女歌唱的声音吗？仆人何必累赘我主我王呢？ I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 仆人只要送王过约但河，王何必赐我这样的恩典呢？ Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 求你准我回去，好死在我本城，葬在我父母的墓旁。这里有王的仆人金罕，让他同我主我王过去，可以随意待他。” Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 王说：“金罕可以与我同去，我必照你的心愿待他。你向我求什么，我都必为你成就。” And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 于是众民过约但河，王也过去。王与巴西莱亲嘴，为他祝福。巴西莱就回本地去了。 And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 王过去，到了吉甲，金罕也跟他过去。犹大众民和以色列民的一半，也都送王过去。 Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 以色列众人来见王，对他说：“我们弟兄犹大人为什么暗暗送王和王的家眷，并跟随王的人，过约但河？” And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 犹大众人回答以色列人说：“因为王与我们是亲属，你们为何因这事发怒呢？我们吃了王的什么呢？王赏赐了我们什么呢？” And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 以色列人回答犹大人说：“按支派我们与王有十分的情分，在大卫身上，我们也比你们更有情分，你们为何藐视我们，请王回来，不先与我们商量呢？”但犹大人的话，比以色列人的话更硬。 And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor10_20">撒母耳记下 20</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 在那里，恰巧有一个匪徒，名叫示巴，是便雅悯人比基利的儿子。他吹角说：“我们与大卫无分，与耶西的儿子无涉。以色列人哪！你们各回各家去吧！” And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 于是以色列人都离开大卫，跟随比基利的儿子示巴。但犹大人，从约但河直到耶路撒冷，都紧紧跟随他们的王。 So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 大卫王来到耶路撒冷，进了宫殿，就把从前留下看守宫殿的十个妃嫔禁闭在冷宫，养活她们，不与她们亲近。她们如同寡妇被禁，直到死的日子。 And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 王对亚玛撒说：“你要在三日之内，将犹大人招聚了来，你也回到这里来。” Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 亚玛撒就去招聚犹大人，却耽延过了王所限的日期。 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 大卫对亚比筛说：“现在恐怕比基利的儿子示巴加害于我们，比押沙龙更甚。你要带领你主的仆人追赶他，免得他得了坚固城，躲避我们。” And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 约押的人和基利提人、比利提人并所有的勇士，都跟着亚比筛，从耶路撒冷出去，追赶比基利的儿子示巴。 And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 他们到了基遍的大磐石那里，亚玛撒来迎接他们。那时约押穿着战衣，腰束佩刀的带子，刀在鞘内，约押前行，刀从鞘内掉出来。 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 约押左手拾起刀来，对亚玛撒说：“我兄弟，你好啊！”就用右手抓住亚玛撒的胡子，要与他亲嘴。 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 亚玛撒没有防备约押手里所拿的刀，约押用刀刺入他的肚腹，他的肠子流在地上，没有再刺他，就死了。约押和他兄弟亚比筛往前追赶比基利的儿子示巴。 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 有约押的一个少年人站在亚玛撒尸身旁边，对众人说：“谁喜悦约押，谁归顺大卫，就当跟随约押去。” And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 亚玛撒在道路上滚在自己的血里。那人见众民经过都站住，就把亚玛撒的尸身从路上挪到田间，用衣服遮盖。 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 尸身从路上挪移之后，众民就都跟随约押，去追赶比基利的儿子示巴。 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他走遍以色列各支派，直到伯玛迦的亚比拉，并比利人的全地；那些地方的人也都聚集跟随他。 And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 约押和跟随的人到了伯玛迦的亚比拉，围困示巴，就对着城筑垒。跟随约押的众民用锤撞城，要使城塌陷。 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 有一个聪明妇人从城上呼叫说：“听啊！听啊！请约押近前来，我好与他说话。” Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 约押就近前来，妇人问他说：“你是约押不是？”他说：“我是。”妇人说：“求你听婢女的话。”约押说：“我听。” And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 妇人说：“古时有话说，当先在亚比拉求问，然后事就定妥。 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 我们这城的人，在以色列人中，是和平忠厚的。你为何要毁坏以色列中的大城，吞灭耶和华的产业呢？” I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 约押回答说：“我决不吞灭毁坏。 And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 乃因以法莲山地的一个人，比基利的儿子示巴，举手攻击大卫王，你们若将他一人交出来，我便离城而去。”妇人对约押说：“那人的首级必从城墙上丢给你。” The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 妇人就凭她的智慧去劝众人，他们便割下比基利的儿子示巴的首级，丢给约押。约押吹角，众人就离城而散，各归各家去了。约押回耶路撒冷到王那里。 Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 约押作以色列全军的元帅：耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅统辖基利提人和比利提人； Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 亚多兰掌管服苦的人；亚希律的儿子约沙法作史官； And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 示法作书记；撒督和亚比亚他作祭司长； And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 睚珥人以拉作大卫的宰相。 And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor10_21">撒母耳记下 21</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 大卫年间有饥荒，一连三年，大卫就求问耶和华。耶和华说：“这饥荒是因扫罗和他流人血之家，杀死基遍人。” Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 原来这基遍人不是以色列人，乃是亚摩利人中所剩的；以色列人曾向他们起誓，不杀灭他们。扫罗却为以色列人和犹大人发热心，想要杀灭他们。大卫王召了他们来。 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 问他们说：“我当为你们怎样行呢？可用什么赎这罪，使你们为耶和华的产业祝福呢？” Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 基遍人回答说：“我们和扫罗与他家的事并不关乎金银，也不要因我们的缘故杀一个以色列人。”大卫说：“你们怎样说，我就为你们怎样行。” And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他们对王说：“那从前谋害我们，要灭我们，使我们不得再住以色列境内的人， And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 现在愿将他的子孙七人交给我们，我们好在耶和华面前，将他们悬挂在耶和华拣选扫罗的基比亚。”王说：“我必交给你们。” Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 王因为曾与扫罗的儿子约拿单指着耶和华起誓结盟，就爱惜扫罗的孙子，约拿单的儿子米非波设，不交出来； But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 却把爱雅的女儿利斯巴给扫罗所生的两个儿子亚摩尼、米非波设，和扫罗女儿米甲的姐姐给米何拉人巴西莱儿子亚得列所生的五个儿子， But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 交在基遍人的手里。基遍人就把他们在耶和华面前，悬挂在山上，这七人就一同死亡。被杀的时候，正是收割的日子，就是动手割大麦的时候。 And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 爱雅的女儿利斯巴用麻布在磐石上搭棚，从动手收割的时候，直到天降雨在尸身上的时候。日间不容空中的雀鸟落在尸身上，夜间不让田野的走兽前来糟践。 And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 有人将扫罗的妃嫔爱雅女儿利斯巴所行的这事告诉大卫。 And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 大卫就去，从基列雅比人那里将扫罗和他儿子约拿单的骸骨搬了来；是因非利士人从前在基利波杀扫罗，将尸身悬挂在伯珊的街市上，基列雅比人把尸身偷了去。 And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 大卫将扫罗和他儿子约拿单的骸骨从那里搬了来，又收殓被悬挂七人的骸骨， And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 将扫罗和他儿子约拿单的骸骨葬在便雅悯的洗拉，在扫罗父亲基士的坟墓里。众人行了王所吩咐的。此后　神垂听国民所求的。 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was intreated for the land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 非利士人与以色列人打仗，大卫带领仆人下去，与非利士人接战，大卫就疲乏了。 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 伟人的一个儿子以实比诺要杀大卫，他的铜枪重三百舍客勒，又佩着新刀。 And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 但洗鲁雅的儿子亚比筛帮助大卫，攻打非利士人，将他杀死。当日跟随大卫的人向大卫起誓说：“以后你不可再与我们一同出战，恐怕熄灭以色列的灯。” But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 后来，以色列人在歌伯与非利士人打仗，户沙人西比该杀了伟人的一个儿子撒弗。 And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 又在歌伯与非利士人打仗，伯利恒人雅雷俄珥金的儿子伊勒哈难杀了迦特人歌利亚。这人的枪杆粗如织布的机轴。 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 又在迦特打仗，那里有一个身量高大的人，手脚都是六指，共有二十四个指头；他也是伟人的儿子。 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 这人向以色列人骂阵，大卫的哥哥示米亚的儿子约拿单就杀了他。 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 这四个人是迦特伟人的儿子，都死在大卫和他仆人的手下。 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor10_22">撒母耳记下 22</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 当耶和华救大卫脱离一切仇敌和扫罗之手的日子，他向耶和华念这诗， And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 说：耶和华是我的岩石，我的山寨，我的救主， And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 我的　神，我的磐石，我所投靠的；他是我的盾牌，是拯救我的角，是我的高台，是我的避难所。我的救主啊！你是救我脱离强暴的。 The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 我要求告当赞美的耶和华，这样，我必从仇敌手中被救出来。 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 曾有死亡的波浪环绕我，匪类的急流使我惊惧； When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 阴间的绳索缠绕我，死亡的网罗临到我。 The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 我在急难中求告耶和华，向我的　神呼求。他从殿中听了我的声音。我的呼求入了他的耳中。 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 那时因他发怒，地就摇撼战抖，天的根基也震动摇撼。 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 从他鼻孔冒烟上腾，从他口中发火焚烧，连炭也着了。 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 他又使天下垂，亲自降临。有黑云在他脚下。 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 他坐着基路伯飞行，在风的翅膀上显现。 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他以黑暗和聚集的水，天空的厚云，为他四围的行宫。 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 因他面前的光辉，炭都着了。 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 耶和华从天上打雷，至高者发出声音。 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 他射出箭来，使仇敌四散；发出闪电，使他们扰乱。 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 耶和华的斥责一发，鼻孔的气一出，海底就出现，大地的根基也显露。 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 他从高天伸手抓住我，把我从大水中拉上来。 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 他救我脱离我的劲敌和那些恨我的人，因为他们比我强盛。 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 我遭遇灾难的日子，他们来攻击我；但耶和华是我的倚靠。 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 他又领我到宽阔之处。他救拔我，因他喜悦我。 He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 因为我遵守了耶和华的道，未曾作恶离开我的　神。 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 他的一切典章，常在我面前；他的律例，我也未曾离弃。 For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 我在他面前作了完全人，我也保守自己远离我的罪孽。 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 所以耶和华按我的公义，按我在他眼前的清洁赏赐我。 Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 慈爱的人，你以慈爱待他；完全的人，你以完全待他； With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 耶和华啊！你是我的灯，耶和华必照明我的黑暗。 For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 我借着你冲入敌军，借着我的　神跳过墙垣。 For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 至于　神，他的道是完全的；耶和华的话是炼净的，凡投靠他的，他便作他们的盾牌。 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 他使我的脚快如母鹿的蹄，又使我在高处安稳。 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high places.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 他教导我的手能以争战，甚至我的膀臂能开铜弓。 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 你把你的救恩给我作盾牌，你的温和使我为大。 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 你使我脚下的地步宽阔，我的脚未曾滑跌。 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 我追赶我的仇敌，灭绝了他们，未灭以先，我没有归回。 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 我灭绝了他们，打伤了他们，使他们不能起来。他们都倒在我的脚下。 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 因为你曾以力量束我的腰，使我能争战。你也使那起来攻击我的，都服在我以下。 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 你又使我的仇敌，在我面前转背逃跑，叫我能以剪除那恨我的人。 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 他们仰望，却无人拯救；就是呼求耶和华，他也不应允。 They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 我捣碎他们，如同地上的灰尘；践踏他们，四散在地，如同街上的泥土。 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 你救我脱离我百姓的争竞，保护我作列国的元首；我素不认识的民，必事奉我。 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 外邦人要投降我，一听见我的名声，就必顺从我。 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 外邦人要衰残，战战兢兢地出他们的营寨。 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 耶和华是活神！愿我的磐石，被人称颂！愿　神，那拯救我的磐石，被人尊崇！ The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 这位　神就是那为我伸冤，使众民服在我以下的。 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 你救我脱离仇敌，又把我举起，高过那些起来攻击我的，你救我脱离强暴的人。 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 耶和华啊！因此我要在外邦中称谢你，歌颂你的名。 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: 耶和华赐极大的救恩给他所立的王，施慈爱给他的受膏者，就是给大卫和他的后裔，直到永远。 He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor10_23">撒母耳记下 23</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: “耶和华的灵借着我说，他的话在我口中。 The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 以色列的　神，以色列的磐石，晓谕我说：那以公义治理人民的，敬畏　神执掌权柄， The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他必象日出的晨光，如无云的清晨，雨后的晴光，使地发生嫩草。 And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 我家在　神面前并非如此；　神却与我立永远的约。这约凡事坚稳，关乎我的一切救恩和我一切所想望的，他岂不为我成就吗？ Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 但匪类都必象荆棘被丢弃，人不敢用手拿他； But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 拿他的人必带铁器和枪杆，终久他必被火焚烧。” But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 大卫勇士的名字，记在下面：他革扪人约设巴设，又称伊斯尼人亚底挪，他是军长的统领，一时击杀了八百人。 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 其次是亚合人朵多的儿子以利亚撒。从前非利士人聚集要打仗，以色列人迎着上去，有跟随大卫的三个勇士向非利士人骂阵，其中有以利亚撒。 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 他起来击杀非利士人，直到手臂疲乏，手粘住刀把。那日耶和华使以色列人大获全胜，众民在以利亚撒后头专夺财物。 He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 其次是哈拉人亚基的儿子沙玛。一日，非利士人聚集成群，在一块长满红豆的田里，众民就在非利士人面前逃跑。 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 沙玛却站在那田间，击杀非利士人，救护了那田。耶和华使以色列人大获全胜。 But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 收割的时候，有三十个勇士中的三个人，下到亚杜兰洞见大卫，非利士的军兵在利乏音谷安营。 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 那时大卫在山寨，非利士人的防营在伯利恒。 And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 大卫渴想说：“甚愿有人将伯利恒城门旁井里的水打来给我喝。” And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 这三个勇士就闯过非利士人的营盘，从伯利恒城门旁的井里打水，拿来奉给大卫。他却不肯喝，将水奠在耶和华面前， And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 说：“耶和华啊！这三个人冒死去打水，这水好象他们的血一般，我断不敢喝。”如此大卫不肯喝！这是三个勇士所作的事。 And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 洗鲁雅的儿子约押的兄弟亚比筛是这三个勇士的首领。他举枪杀了三百人，就在三个勇士里得了名。 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他在这三个勇士里，是最尊贵的，所以作他们的首领；只是不及前三个勇士。 Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 有甲薛勇士耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅行过大能的事，他杀了摩押人亚利伊勒的两个儿子；又在下雪的时候下坑里去，杀了一个狮子； And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 又杀了一个强壮的埃及人；埃及人手里拿着枪，比拿雅只拿着棍子下去，从埃及人手里夺过枪来，用那枪将他杀死。 And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 这是耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅所行的事，就在三个勇士里得了名。 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 他比那三十个勇士都尊贵，只是不及前三个勇士。大卫立他作护卫长。 He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three.

And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他们过了约但河，在迦得谷中城的右边亚罗珥安营，与雅谢相对； And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 又到了基列和他停合示地；又到了但雅安，绕到西顿， Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 来到推罗的保障，并希未人和迦南人的各城；又到犹大南方的别是巴。 And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 他们走遍全地，过了九个月零二十天，就回到耶路撒冷。 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 约押将百姓的总数奏告于王：以色列拿刀的勇士有八十万；犹大有五十万。 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 大卫数点百姓以后，就心中自责，祷告耶和华说：“我行这事大有罪了。耶和华啊！求你除掉仆人的罪孽，因我所行的甚是愚昧。” And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 大卫早晨起来，耶和华的话临到先知迦得，就是大卫的先见，说： For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: “你去告诉大卫，说耶和华如此说：‘我有三样灾，随你选择一样，我好降与你。’” Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 于是迦得来见大卫，对他说：“你愿意国中有七年的饥荒呢？是在你敌人面前逃跑，被追赶三个月呢？是在你国中有三日的瘟疫呢？现在你要揣摩思想，我好回复那差我来的。” So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 大卫对迦得说：“我甚为难。我愿落在耶和华的手里，因为他有丰盛的怜悯；我不愿落在人的手里。” And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 于是耶和华降瘟疫与以色列人，自早晨到所定的时候。从但直到别是巴，民间死了七万人。 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 天使向耶路撒冷伸手要灭城的时候，耶和华后悔，就不降这灾了。吩咐灭民的天使说：“够了！住手吧！”那时耶和华的使者在耶布斯人亚劳拿的禾场那里。 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 大卫看见灭民的天使，就祷告耶和华说：“我犯了罪，行了恶；但这群羊作了什么呢？愿你的手攻击我和我的父家。” And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 当日迦得来见大卫，对他说：“你上去，在耶布斯人亚劳拿的禾场上，为耶和华筑一座坛。” And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 大卫就照着迦得奉耶和华名所说的话，上去了。 And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 亚劳拿观看，见王和他臣仆前来，就迎接出去，脸伏于地，向王下拜， And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 说：“我主我王为何来到仆人这里呢？”大卫说：“我要买你这禾场，为耶和华筑一座坛，使民间的瘟疫止住。” And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 亚劳拿对大卫说：“我主我王，你喜悦用什么，就拿去献祭。看哪，这里有牛，可以作燔祭；有打粮的器具和套牛的轭，可以当柴烧。 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 王啊！这一切我亚劳拿都奉给你。”又对王说：“愿耶和华你的　神悦纳你。” All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 王对亚劳拿说：“不然，我必要按着价值向你买，我不肯用白得之物作燔祭，献给耶和华我的　神。”大卫就用五十舍客勒银子，买了那禾场与牛。 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 大卫在那里为耶和华筑了一座坛，献燔祭和平安祭。如此耶和华垂听国民所求的，瘟疫在以色列人中就止住了。 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</p>
