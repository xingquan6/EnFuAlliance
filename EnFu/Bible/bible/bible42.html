for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 天使回答说：“我是站在　神面前的加百列，奉差而来，对你说话，将这好信息报给你。 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 到了时候，这话必然应验；只因你不信，你必哑巴，不能说话，直到这事成就的日子。” And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 百姓等候撒迦利亚，诧异他许久在殿里。 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 及至他出来，不能和他们说话，他们就知道他在殿里见了异象，因为他直向他们打手式，竟成了哑巴。 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 他供职的日子已满，就回家去了。 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 这些日子以后，他的妻子以利沙伯怀了孕，就隐藏了五个月， And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 说：“主在眷顾我的日子，这样看待我，要把我在人间的羞耻除掉。” Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 到了第六个月，天使加百列奉　神的差遣，往加利利的一座城去，这城名叫拿撒勒； And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 到一个童女那里，是已经许配大卫家的一个人，名叫约瑟；童女的名字叫马利亚。 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 天使进去，对她说：“蒙大恩的女子，我问你安，主和你同在了！” And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 马利亚因这话就很惊慌，又反复思想这样问安是什么意思。 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 天使对她说：“马利亚，不要怕，你在　神面前已经蒙恩了。 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 你要怀孕生子，可以给他起名叫耶稣。 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 他要为大，称为至高者的儿子；主　神要把他祖大卫的位给他。 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 他要作雅各家的王，直到永远；他的国也没有穷尽。” And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 马利亚对天使说：“我没有出嫁，怎么有这事呢？” Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 天使回答说：“圣灵要临到你身上，至高者的能力要荫庇你；因此所要生的圣者，必称为　神的儿子(或作“所要生的，必称为圣，称为　神的儿子”)。 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 况且你的亲戚以利沙伯，在年老的时候，也怀了男胎；就是那素来称为不生育的，现在有孕六个月了。 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 因为出于　神的话，没有一句不带能力的。” For with God nothing shall be impossible.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 马利亚说：“我是主的使女，情愿照你的话成就在我身上。”天使就离开她去了。 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 那时候，马利亚起身，急忙往山地里去，来到犹大的一座城； And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 进了撒迦利亚的家，问以利沙伯安。 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 以利沙伯一听马利亚问安，所怀的胎就在腹里跳动；以利沙伯且被圣灵充满， And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 高声喊着说：“你在妇女中是有福的！你所怀的胎也是有福的！ And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 我主的母到我这里来，这是从哪里得的呢！ And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 因为你问安的声音一入我耳，我腹里的胎就欢喜跳动。 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 这相信的女子是有福的！因为主对她所说的话都要应验。” And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 马利亚说：“我心尊主为大， And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 我灵以　神我的救主为乐； And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 因为他顾念他使女的卑微，从今以后，万代要称我有福。 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 那有权能的，为我成就了大事，他的名为圣。 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 他怜悯敬畏他的人，直到世世代代。 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: 他用膀臂施展大能；那狂傲的人，正心里妄想，就被他赶散了。 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">52: 他叫有权柄的失位，叫卑贱的升高； He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">53: 叫饥饿的得饱美食，叫富足的空手回去。 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">54: 他扶助了他的仆人以色列， He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">55: 为要记念亚伯拉罕和他的后裔，施怜悯，直到永远，正如从前对我们列祖所说的话。” As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">56: 马利亚和以利沙伯同住，约有三个月，就回家去了。 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">57: 以利沙伯的产期到了，就生了一个儿子。 Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">58: 邻里亲族听见主向她大施怜悯，就和她一同欢乐。 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">59: 到了第八日，他们来要给孩子行割礼；并要照他父亲的名字叫他撒迦利亚。 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">60: 他母亲说：“不可！要叫他约翰。” And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">61: 他们说：“你亲族中没有叫这名字的。” And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">62: 他们就向他父亲打手式，问他要叫这孩子什么名字。 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">63: 他要了一块写字的板，就写上，说：“他的名字是约翰。”他们便都希奇。 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">64: 撒迦利亚的口立时开了，舌头也舒展了，就说出话来，称颂　神。 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">65: 周围居住的人都惧怕，这一切的事就传遍了犹太的山地。 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">66: 凡听见的人都将这事放在心里，说：“这个孩子将来怎么样呢？”因为有主与他同在。 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">67: 他父亲撒迦利亚被圣灵充满了，就预言说： And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">68: “主以色列的　神是应当称颂的！因他眷顾他的百姓，为他们施行救赎； Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">69: 在他仆人大卫家中，为我们兴起了拯救的角； And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">70: (正如主借着从创世以来，圣先知的口所说的话。) As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">71: 拯救我们脱离仇敌，和一切恨我们之人的手； That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">72: 向我们列祖施怜悯，记念他的圣约， To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">73: 就是他对我们祖宗亚伯拉罕所起的誓， The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">74: 叫我们既从仇敌手中被救出来， That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">75: 就可以终身在他面前，坦然无惧地用圣洁、公义事奉他。 In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">76: 孩子啊！你要称为至高者的先知；因为你要行在主的前面，预备他的道路， And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">77: 叫他的百姓因罪得赦，就知道救恩； To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">78: 因我们　神怜悯的心肠，叫清晨的日光从高天临到我们， Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">79: 要照亮坐在黑暗中死荫里的人，把我们的脚引到平安的路上。” To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">80: 那孩子渐渐长大，心灵强健，住在旷野，直到他显明在以色列人面前的日子。 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor42_2">路加福音 2</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 当那些日子，奥古斯都凯撒有旨意下来，叫天下人民都报名上册。 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 这是居里扭作叙利亚巡抚的时候，头一次行报名上册的事。 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 众人各归各城，报名上册。 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 约瑟也从加利利的拿撒勒城上犹太去，到了大卫的城，名叫伯利恒，因他本是大卫一族一家的人， And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 要和他所聘之妻马利亚一同报名上册。那时马利亚的身孕已经重了。 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他们在那里的时候，马利亚的产期到了， And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 就生了头胎的儿子，用布包起来，放在马槽里，因为客店里没有地方。 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 在伯利恒之野地里有牧羊的人，夜间按着更次看守羊群。 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 有主的使者站在他们旁边，主的荣光四面照着他们；牧羊的人就甚惧怕。 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 那天使对他们说：“不要惧怕！我报给你们大喜的信息，是关乎万民的； And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 因今天在大卫的城里，为你们生了救主，就是主基督。 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 你们要看见一个婴孩，包着布，卧在马槽里，那就是记号了。” And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 忽然，有一大队天兵同那天使赞美　神说： And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: “在至高之处荣耀归与　神！在地上平安归与他所喜悦的人(有古卷作“喜悦归与人”)！” Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 众天使离开他们升天去了，牧羊的人彼此说：“我们往伯利恒去，看看所成的事，就是主所指示我们的。” And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 他们急忙去了，就寻见马利亚和约瑟，又有那婴孩卧在马槽里； And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 既然看见，就把天使论这孩子的话传开了。 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 凡听见的，就诧异牧羊之人对他们所说的话。 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 马利亚却把这一切的事存在心里，反复思想。 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 牧羊的人回去了，因所听见所看见的一切事，正如天使向他们所说的，就归荣耀与　神，赞美他。 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 满了八天，就给孩子行割礼，与他起名叫耶稣；这就是没有成胎以前，天使所起的名。 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 按摩西律法满了洁净的日子，他们带着孩子上耶路撒冷去，要把他献与主。 And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: (正如主的律法上所记：“凡头生的男子，必称圣归主；”) (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 现在已经八十四岁(或作“就寡居了八十四年”)；并不离开圣殿，禁食祈求，昼夜事奉　神。 And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 正当那时，她进前来称谢　神，将孩子的事对一切盼望耶路撒冷得救赎的人讲说。 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 约瑟和马利亚照主的律法，办完了一切的事，就回加利利，到自己的城拿撒勒去了。 And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 以为他在同行的人中间，走了一天的路程，就在亲族和熟识的人中找他。 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 既找不着，就回耶路撒冷去找他。 And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 过了三天，就遇见他在殿里，坐在教师中间，一面听，一面问。 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 耶稣说：“为什么找我呢？岂不知我应当以我父的事为念吗？(或作“岂不知我应当在我父的家里吗？”)” And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 他所说的这话，他们不明白。 And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: 他就同他们下去，回到拿撒勒，并且顺从他们。他母亲把这一切的事都存在心里。 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">52: 耶稣的智慧和身量(“身量”或作“年纪”)，并　神和人喜爱他的心，都一齐增长。 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor42_3">路加福音 3</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 耶稣对他们说：“你们必引这俗语向我说：‘医生，你医治自己吧！我们听见你在迦百农所行的事，也当行在你自己家乡里。’” And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 又说：“我实在告诉你们，没有先知在自己家乡被人悦纳的。 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 我对你们说实话，当以利亚的时候，天闭塞了三年零六个月，遍地有大饥荒，那时，以色列中有许多寡妇； But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 以利亚并没有奉差往她们一个人那里去，只奉差往西顿的撒勒法一个寡妇那里去。 But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 先知以利沙的时候，以色列中有许多长大麻风的，但内中除了叙利亚国的乃缦，没有一个得洁净的。” And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 会堂里的人听见这话，都怒气满胸。 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 就起来撵他出城(他们的城造在山上)；他们带他到山崖，要把他推下去。 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 他却从他们中间直行，过去了。 But he passing through the midst of them went his way,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 耶稣下到迦百农，就是加利利的一座城，在安息日教训众人。 And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 他们很希奇他的教训，因为他的话里有权柄。 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 在会堂里有一个人，被污鬼的精气附着，大声喊叫说： And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: “唉！拿撒勒的耶稣，我们与你有什么相干？你来灭我们吗？我知道你是谁，乃是　神的圣者。” Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 耶稣责备他说：“不要作声，从这人身上出来吧！”鬼把那人摔倒在众人中间，就出来了，却也没有害他。 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 众人都惊讶，彼此对问说：“这是什么道理呢？因为他用权柄能力吩咐污鬼，污鬼就出来。” And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 于是耶稣的名声传遍了周围地方。 And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 耶稣出了会堂，进了西门的家。西门的岳母害热病甚重，有人为她求耶稣。 And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 耶稣站在她旁边，斥责那热病，热就退了。她立刻起来服事他们。 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 日落的时候，凡有病人的，不论害什么病，都带到耶稣那里。耶稣按手在他们各人身上，医好他们。 Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 又有鬼从好些人身上出来，喊着说：“你是　神的儿子。”耶稣斥责他们，不许他们说话，因为他们知道他是基督。 And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 天亮的时候，耶稣出来，走到旷野地方。众人去找他，到了他那里，要留住他，不要他离开他们。 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 但耶稣对他们说：“我也必须在别城传　神国的福音，因我奉差原是为此。” And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 于是耶稣在加利利的各会堂传道。 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor42_5">路加福音 5</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶稣站在革尼撒勒湖边，众人拥挤他，要听　神的道。 And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 他见有两只船湾在湖边；打鱼的人却离开船洗网去了。 And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 有一只船是西门的，耶稣就上去，请他把船撑开，稍微离岸，就坐下，从船上教训众人。 And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 讲完了，对西门说：“把船开到水深之处，下网打鱼。” Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 西门说：“夫子，我们整夜劳力，并没有打着什么。但依从你的话，我就下网。” And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他们下了网，就圈住许多鱼，网险些裂开， And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 便招呼那只船上的同伴来帮助。他们就来把鱼装满了两只船，甚至船要沉下去。 And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 西门彼得看见，就俯伏在耶稣膝前，说：“主啊！离开我，我是个罪人。” When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他和一切同在的人都惊讶这一网所打的鱼。 For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 他的伙伴西庇太的儿子雅各、约翰，也是这样。耶稣对西门说：“不要怕！从今以后，你要得人了。” And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 他们把两只船拢了岸，就撇下所有的，跟从了耶稣。 And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 有一回，耶稣在一个城里，有人满身长了大麻风，看见他，就俯伏在地求他说：“主若肯，必能叫我洁净了。” And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 耶稣伸手摸他，说：“我肯，你洁净了吧！”大麻风立刻就离了他的身。 And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 耶稣嘱咐他：“你切不可告诉人，只要去把身体给祭司察看，又要为你得了洁净，照摩西所吩咐的，献上礼物，对众人作证据。” And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 但耶稣的名声越发传扬出去。有极多的人聚集来听道，也指望医治他们的病。 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 耶稣却退到旷野去祷告。 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 有一天，耶稣教训人，有法利赛人和教法师在旁边坐着，他们是从加利利各乡村和犹太并耶路撒冷来的。主的能力与耶稣同在，使他能医治病人。 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 有人用褥子抬着一个瘫子，要抬进去放在耶稣面前， And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 却因人多，寻不出法子抬进去，就上了房顶，从瓦间把他连褥子缒到当中，正在耶稣面前。 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 耶稣见他们的信心，就对瘫子说：“你的罪赦了。” And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 文士和法利赛人就议论说：“这说僭妄话的是谁？除了　神以外，谁能赦罪呢？” And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 耶稣知道他们所议论的，就说：“你们心里议论的是什么呢？ But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 或说：‘你的罪赦了；’或说：‘你起来行走；’哪一样容易呢？ Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 但要叫你们知道人子在地上有赦罪的权柄，”就对瘫子说：“我吩咐你，起来！拿你的褥子回家去吧。” But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 那人当众人面前立刻起来，拿着他所躺卧的褥子回家去，归荣耀与　神。 And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 众人都惊奇，也归荣耀与　神，并且满心惧怕说：“我们今日看见非常的事了。” And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 这事以后，耶稣出去，看见一个税吏，名叫利未，坐在税关上；就对他说：“你跟从我来。” And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 他就撇下所有的，起来，跟从了耶稣。 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 利未在自己家里为耶稣大摆筵席，有许多税吏和别人与他们一同坐席。 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 法利赛人和文士就向耶稣的门徒发怨言说：“你们为什么和税吏并罪人一同吃喝呢？” But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 耶稣对他们说：“无病的人用不着医生；有病的人才用得着。 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 我来本不是召义人悔改；乃是召罪人悔改。” I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 他们说：“约翰的门徒屡次禁食祈祷，法利赛人的门徒也是这样；惟独你的门徒又吃又喝。” And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 耶稣对他们说：“新郎和陪伴之人同在的时候，岂能叫陪伴之人禁食呢？ And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 但日子将到，新郎要离开他们，那日他们就要禁食了。” But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 耶稣又设一个比喻，对他们说：“没有人把新衣服撕下一块来补在旧衣服上；若是这样，就把新的撕破了，并且所撕下来的那块新的，和旧的也不相称。 And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 也没有人把新酒装在旧皮袋里；若是这样，新酒必将皮袋裂开，酒便漏出来，皮袋也就坏了。 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 但新酒必须装在新皮袋里。 But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 没有人喝了陈酒又想喝新的，他总说陈的好。” No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor42_6">路加福音 6</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 有一个安息日，耶稣从麦地经过。他的门徒掐了麦穗，用手搓着吃。 And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 有几个法利赛人说：“你们为什么作安息日不可作的事呢？” And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 耶稣对他们说：“经上记着大卫和跟从他的人饥饿之时所作的事，连这个你们也没有念过吗？ And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他怎么进了　神的殿，拿陈设饼吃，又给跟从的人吃？这饼除了祭司以外，别人都不可吃。” How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 又对他们说：“人子是安息日的主。” And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 又有一个安息日，耶稣进了会堂教训人，在那里有一个人右手枯干了。 And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 文士和法利赛人窥探耶稣，在安息日治病不治病，要得把柄去告他。 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 耶稣却知道他们的意念，就对那枯干一只手的人说：“起来！站在当中。”那人就起来，站着。 But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 耶稣对他们说：“我问你们，在安息日行善行恶，救命害命，哪样是可以的呢？” Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 他就周围看着他们众人，对那人说：“伸出手来！”他把手一伸，手就复了原。 And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 他们就满心大怒，彼此商议怎样处治耶稣。 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 那时，耶稣出去，上山祷告，整夜祷告　神； And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 到了天亮，叫他的门徒来，就从他们中间挑选十二个人，称他们为使徒。 And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 这十二个人有西门，耶稣又给他起名叫彼得，还有他兄弟安得烈；又有雅各和约翰，腓力和巴多罗买； Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 马太和多马；亚勒腓的儿子雅各和奋锐党的西门； Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 雅各的儿子犹大(“儿子”或作“兄弟”)，和卖主的加略人犹大。 And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 耶稣和他们下了山，站在一块平地上；同站的有许多门徒，又有许多百姓，从犹太全地和耶路撒冷，并推罗、西顿的海边来，都要听他讲道，又指望医治他们的病； And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 还有被污鬼缠磨的，也得了医治。 And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 众人都想要摸他，因为有能力从他身上发出来，医好了他们。 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 耶稣举目看着门徒，说：“你们贫穷的人有福了！因为　神的国是你们的。 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 你们饥饿的人有福了！因为你们将要饱足。你们哀哭的人有福了！因为你们将要喜笑。 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 人为人子恨恶你们，拒绝你们，辱骂你们，弃掉你们的名，以为是恶，你们就有福了！ Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 当那日，你们要欢喜跳跃，因为你们在天上的赏赐是大的；他们的祖宗待先知也是这样。 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 但你们富足的人有祸了！因为你们受过你们的安慰。 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 你们饱足的人有祸了！因为你们将要饥饿。你们喜笑的人有祸了！因为你们将要哀恸哭泣。 Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 人都说你们好的时候，你们就有祸了！因为他们的祖宗待假先知也是这样。 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: “只是我告诉你们这听道的人，你们的仇敌，要爱他！恨你们的，要待他好！ But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 咒诅你们的，要为他祝福！凌辱你们的，要为他祷告！ Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 有人打你这边的脸，连那边的脸也由他打；有人夺你的外衣，连里衣也由他拿去。 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 凡求你的，就给他；有人夺你的东西去，不用再要回来。 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 你们愿意人怎样待你们，你们也要怎样待人。 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 你们若单爱那爱你们的人，有什么可酬谢的呢？就是罪人也爱那爱他们的人。 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 你们若善待那善待你们的人，有什么可酬谢的呢？就是罪人也是这样行。 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 你们若借给人，指望从他收回，有什么可酬谢的呢？就是罪人也借给罪人，要如数收回。 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 你们倒要爱仇敌，也要善待他们，并要借给人不指望偿还；你们的赏赐就必大了，你们也必作至高者的儿子；因为他恩待那忘恩的和作恶的。 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 你们要慈悲，象你们的父慈悲一样。 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: “你们不要论断人，就不被论断；你们不要定人的罪，就不被定罪；你们要饶恕人，就必蒙饶恕(“饶恕”原文作“释放”)； Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 你们要给人，就必有给你们的，并且用十足的升斗，连摇带按，上尖下流地倒在你们怀里；因为你们用什么量器量给人，也必用什么量器量给你们。” Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 耶稣又用比喻对他们说：“瞎子岂能领瞎子，两个人不是都要掉在坑里吗？ And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 学生不能高过先生；凡学成了的不过和先生一样。 The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 为什么看见你弟兄眼中有刺，却不想自己眼中有梁木呢？ And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 你不见自己眼中有梁木，怎能对你弟兄说：‘容我去掉你眼中的刺’呢？你这假冒为善的人！先去掉自己眼中的梁木，然后才能看得清楚，去掉你弟兄眼中的刺。 Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: “因为没有好树结坏果子；也没有坏树结好果子。 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 凡树木看果子，就可以认出它来。人不是从荆棘上摘无花果，也不是从蒺藜里摘葡萄。 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 善人从他心里所存的善就发出善来；恶人从他心里所存的恶就发出恶来；因为心里所充满的，口里就说出来。 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: “你们为什么称呼我‘主啊！主啊！’却不遵我的话行呢？ And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 凡到我这里来，听见我的话就去行的，我要告诉你们他象什么人： Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 他象一个人盖房子，深深地挖地，把根基安在磐石上；到发大水的时候，水冲那房子，房子总不能摇动，因为根基立在磐石上(有古卷作“因为盖造得好”)。 He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 惟有听见不去行的，就象一个人在土地上盖房子，没有根基；水一冲，随即倒塌了，并且那房子坏得很大。” But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor42_7">路加福音 7</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶稣对百姓讲完了这一切的话，就进了迦百农。 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 有一个百夫长所宝贵的仆人害病快要死了。 And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 百夫长风闻耶稣的事，就托犹太人的几个长老去求耶稣来救他的仆人。 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他们到了耶稣那里，就切切地求他说：“你给他行这事是他所配得的， And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 因为他爱我们的百姓，给我们建造会堂。” For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 耶稣就和他们同去。离那家不远，百夫长托几个朋友去见耶稣，对他说：“主啊！不要劳动；因你到我舍下，我不敢当； Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 我也自以为不配去见你，只要你说一句话，我的仆人就必好了。 Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 因为我在人的权下，也有兵在我以下，对这个说：‘去！’他就去，对那个说：‘来！’他就来；对我的仆人说：‘你作这事！’他就去作。” For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 耶稣听见这话，就希奇他，转身对跟随的众人说：“我告诉你们，这么大的信心，就是在以色列中，我也没有遇见过。” When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 那托来的人回到百夫长家里，看见仆人已经好了。 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 过了不多时(有古卷作“次日”)，耶稣往一座城去，这城名叫拿因，他的门徒和极多的人与他同行。 And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 将近城门，有一个死人被抬出来；这人是他母亲独生的儿子，他母亲又是寡妇；有城里的许多人同着寡妇送殡。 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 主看见那寡妇就怜悯她，对她说：“不要哭。” And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 于是进前按着杠，抬的人就站住了。耶稣说：“少年人，我吩咐你，起来！” And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 那死人就坐起，并且说话。耶稣便把他交给他母亲。 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 众人都惊奇，归荣耀与　神说：“有大先知在我们中间兴起来了！”又说：“　神眷顾了他的百姓！” And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 他这事的风声就传遍了犹太和周围地方。 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 约翰的门徒把这些事都告诉约翰。 And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他便叫了两个门徒来，打发他们到主那里去，说：“那将要来的是你吗？还是我们等候别人呢？” And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 那两个人来到耶稣那里，说：“施洗的约翰打发我们来问你：‘那将要来的是你吗？还是我们等候别人呢？’” When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 正当那时候，耶稣治好了许多有疾病的，受灾患的，被恶鬼附着的，又开恩叫好些瞎子能看见。 And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 耶稣回答说：“你们去，把所看见所听见的事告诉约翰，就是瞎子看见，瘸子行走，长大麻风的洁净，聋子听见，死人复活，穷人有福音传给他们。 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 凡不因我跌倒的，就有福了！” And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 约翰所差来的人既走了，耶稣就对众人讲论约翰说：“你们从前出去到旷野，是要看什么呢？要看风吹动的芦苇吗？ And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 你们出去，到底是要看什么？要看穿细软衣服的人吗？那穿华丽衣服，宴乐度日的人是在王宫里。 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 你们出去，究竟是要看什么？要看先知吗？我告诉你们，是的，他比先知大多了。 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 经上记着说：‘我要差遣我的使者在你前面，预备道路。’所说的就是这个人。 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 我告诉你们，凡妇人所生的，没有一个大过约翰的；然而　神国里最小的比他还大。” For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 众百姓和税吏既受过约翰的洗，听见这话，就以　神为义； And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 两节或作“众百姓和税吏听见了约翰的话，就受了他的洗，便以　神为义；但法利赛人和律法师不受约翰的洗，竟为自己废弃了　神的旨意。”)。 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 主又说：“这样，我可用什么比这世代的人呢？他们好象什么呢？ And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 好象孩童坐在街市上，彼此呼叫说：‘我们向你们吹笛，你们不跳舞；我们向你们举哀，你们不啼哭。’ They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 施洗的约翰来，不吃饼，不喝酒，你们说他是被鬼附着的。 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 人子来，也吃也喝，你们说他是贪食好酒的人，是税吏和罪人的朋友。 The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 但智慧之子都以智慧为是。” But wisdom is justified of all her children.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 有一个法利赛人请耶稣和他吃饭；耶稣就到法利赛人家里去坐席。 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 那城里有一个女人，是个罪人，知道耶稣在法利赛人家里坐席，就拿着盛香膏的玉瓶， And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 站在耶稣背后，挨着他的脚哭，眼泪湿了耶稣的脚，就用自己的头发擦干，又用嘴连连亲他的脚，把香膏抹上。 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 请耶稣的法利赛人看见这事，心里说：“这人若是先知，必知道摸他的是谁，是个怎样的女人，乃是个罪人。” Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 耶稣对他说：“西门！我有句话要对你说。”西门说：“夫子，请说。” And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 耶稣说：“一个债主有两个人欠他的债；一个欠五十两银子，一个欠五两银子； There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 因为他们无力偿还，债主就开恩免了他们两个人的债。这两个人哪一个更爱他呢？” And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 西门回答说：“我想是那多得恩免的人。”耶稣说：“你断的不错。” Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 于是转过来向着那女人，便对西门说：“你看见这女人吗？我进了你的家，你没有给我水洗脚；但这女人用眼泪湿了我的脚，用头发擦干。 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 你没有与我亲嘴；但这女人从我进来的时候，就不住地用嘴亲我的脚。 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 你没有用油抹我的头；但这女人用香膏抹我的脚。 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 所以我告诉你，她许多的罪都赦免了，因为她的爱多；但那赦免少的，他的爱就少。” Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 于是对那女人说：“你的罪赦免了。” And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 同席的人心里说：“这是什么人，竟赦免人的罪呢？” And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 耶稣对那女人说：“你的信救了你；平平安安地回去吧！” And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor42_8">路加福音 8</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 过了不多日，耶稣周游各城各乡传道，宣讲　神国的福音。和他同去的有十二个门徒， And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 还有被恶鬼所附，被疾病所累，已经治好的几个妇女，内中有称为抹大拉的马利亚，曾有七个鬼从她身上赶出来； And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 又有希律的家宰苦撒的妻子约亚拿，并苏撒拿，和好些别的妇女，都是用自己的财物供给耶稣和门徒。 And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 当许多人聚集，又有人从各城里出来见耶稣的时候，耶稣就用比喻说： And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: “有一个撒种的出去撒种；撒的时候，有落在路旁的，被人践踏，天上的飞鸟又来吃尽了。 A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 有落在磐石上的，一出来就枯干了，因为得不着滋润。 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 有落在荆棘里的，荆棘一同生长，把它挤住了。 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 又有落在好土里的，生长起来，结实百倍。”耶稣说了这些话，就大声说：“有耳可听的，就应当听。” And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 门徒问耶稣说：“这比喻是什么意思呢？” And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 他说：“　神国的奥秘只叫你们知道；至于别人，就用比喻，叫他们看也看不见，听也听不明。 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: “这比喻乃是这样：种子就是　神的道。 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 那些在路旁的，就是人听了道，随后魔鬼来，从他们心里把道夺去，恐怕他们信了得救。 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 那些在磐石上的，就是人听道，欢喜领受，但心中没有根，不过暂时相信，及至遇见试炼就退后了。 They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 那落在荆棘里的，就是人听了道，走开以后，被今生的思虑、钱财、宴乐、挤住了，便结不出成熟的子粒来。 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 那落在好土里的，就是人听了道，持守在诚实、善良的心里，并且忍耐着结实。 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: “没有人点灯用器皿盖上，或放在床底下，乃是放在灯台上，叫进来的人看见亮光。 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 因为掩藏的事没有不显出来的；隐瞒的事没有不露出来被人知道的。 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 所以，你们应当小心怎样听；因为凡有的，还要加给他；凡没有的，连他自以为有的，也要夺去。” Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 耶稣的母亲和他弟兄来了，因为人多，不得到他跟前。 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 有人告诉他说：“你母亲和你弟兄站在外边，要见你。” And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 耶稣回答说：“听了　神之道而遵行的人，就是我的母亲，我的弟兄了。” And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 有一天，耶稣和门徒上了船，对门徒说：“我们可以渡到湖那边去。”他们就开了船。 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 正行的时候，耶稣睡着了。湖上忽然起了暴风，船将满了水，甚是危险。 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 门徒来叫醒了他，说：“夫子！夫子！我们丧命啦！”耶稣醒了，斥责那狂风大浪；风浪就止住，平静了。 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 耶稣对他们说：“你们的信心在哪里呢？他们又惧怕，又希奇，彼此说：“这到底是谁？他吩咐风和水，连风和水也听从他了。” And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 他们到了格拉森(有古卷作“加大拉”)人的地方，就是加利利的对面。 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 耶稣上了岸，就有城里一个被鬼附着的人迎面而来。这个人许久不穿衣服，不住房子，只住在坟茔里。 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 他见了耶稣，就俯伏在他面前，大声喊叫，说：“至高　神的儿子耶稣，我与你有什么相干？求你不要叫我受苦！” When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 是因耶稣曾吩咐污鬼从那人身上出来。原来这鬼屡次抓住他；他常被人看守，又被铁链和脚镣捆锁，他竟把锁链挣断，被鬼赶到旷野去。 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 耶稣问他说：“你名叫什么？”他说：“我名叫群。”这是因为附着他的鬼多。 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 鬼就央求耶稣，不要吩咐他们到无底坑里去。 And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 那里有一大群猪在山上吃食。鬼央求耶稣，准他们进入猪里去；耶稣准了他们。 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 鬼就从那人出来，进入猪里去。于是那群猪闯下山崖，投在湖里，淹死了。 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 放猪的看见这事就逃跑了，去告诉城里和乡下的人。 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 众人出来要看是什么事；到了耶稣那里，看见鬼所离开的那人，坐在耶稣脚前，穿着衣服，心里明白过来，他们就害怕。 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 看见这事的，便将被鬼附着的人怎么得救，告诉他们。 They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 格拉森四围的人，因为害怕得很，都求耶稣离开他们；耶稣就上船回去了。 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 鬼所离开的那人恳求和耶稣同在；耶稣却打发他回去， Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 说：“你回家去，传说　神为你作了何等大的事。”他就去，满城里传扬耶稣为他作了何等大的事。 Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 耶稣回来的时候，众人迎接他，因为他们都等候他。 And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 有一个管会堂的，名叫睚鲁，来俯伏在耶稣脚前，求耶稣到他家里去； And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 因他有一个独生女儿，约有十二岁，快要死了。耶稣去的时候，众人拥挤他。 For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 有一个女人，患了十二年的血漏，在医生手里花尽了她一切养生的，并没有一人能医好她。 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 她来到耶稣背后，摸他的衣裳繸子，血漏立刻就止住了。 Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 耶稣说：“摸我的是谁！”众人都不承认；彼得和同行的人都说：“夫子，众人拥拥挤挤紧靠着你(有古卷在此有“你还问摸我的是谁吗？”)。” And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 耶稣说：“总有人摸我，因我觉得有能力从我身上出去。” And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 那女人知道不能隐藏，就战战兢兢地来俯伏在耶稣脚前，把摸他的缘故，和怎样立刻得好了，当着众人都说出来。 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 耶稣对她说：“女儿，你的信救了你。平平安安地去吧！” And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 还说话的时候，有人从管会堂的家里来，说：“你的女儿死了，不要劳动夫子。” While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 耶稣听见就对他说：“不要怕！只要信！你的女儿就必得救。” But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: 耶稣到了他的家，除了彼得、约翰、雅各，和女儿的父母，不许别人同他进去。 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">52: 众人都为这女儿哀哭捶胸。耶稣说：“不要哭，她不是死了，是睡着了。” And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">53: 他们晓得女儿已经死了，就嗤笑耶稣， And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">54: 耶稣拉着她的手，呼叫说：“女儿，起来吧！” And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">55: 她的灵魂便回来，她就立刻起来了。耶稣吩咐给她东西吃。 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">56: 她的父母惊奇得很；耶稣嘱咐他们，不要把所作的事告诉人。 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor42_9">路加福音 9</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶稣叫齐了十二个门徒，给他们能力权柄，制伏一切的鬼，医治各样的病， Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 又差遣他们去宣传　神国的道，医治病人； And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 对他们说：“行路的时候，不要带拐杖和口袋，不要带食物和银子，也不要带两件褂子。 And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 无论进哪一家，就住在那里，也从那里起行。 And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 凡不接待你们的，你们离开那城的时候，要把脚上的尘土跺下去，见证他们的不是。” And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 门徒就出去，走遍各乡宣传福音，到处治病。 And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 分封的王希律听见耶稣所作的一切事，就游移不定；因为有人说：“是约翰从死里复活；” Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 又有人说：“是以利亚显现；”还有人说：“是古时的一个先知又活了。” And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 希律说：“约翰我已经斩了，这却是什么人？我竟听见他这样的事呢？”就想要见他。 And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 使徒回来，将所作的事告诉耶稣；耶稣就带他们暗暗地离开那里，往一座城去，那城名叫伯赛大。 And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 但众人知道了，就跟着他去；耶稣便接待他们，对他们讲论　神国的道，医治那些需医的人。 And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 日头快要平西，十二个门徒来对他说：“请叫众人散开，他们好往四面乡村里去借宿找吃的，因为我们这里是野地。” And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 耶稣说：“你们给他们吃吧！”门徒说：“我们不过有五个饼，两条鱼，若不去为这许多人买食物就不够。” But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 那时，人数约有五千。耶稣对门徒说：“叫他们一排一排地坐下，每排大约五十个人。” For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 门徒就如此行，叫众人都坐下。 And they did so, and made them all sit down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 耶稣拿着这五个饼，两条鱼，望着天祝福，掰开，递给门徒，摆在众人面前。 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 他们就吃，并且都吃饱了；把剩下的零碎收拾起来，装满了十二篮子。 And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 耶稣自己祷告的时候，门徒也同他在那里。耶稣问他们说：“众人说我是谁？” And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他们说：“有人说是施洗的约翰；有人说是以利亚；还有人说是古时的一个先知又活了。” They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 耶稣说：“你们说我是谁？”彼得回答说：“是　神所立的基督。” He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 耶稣切切地嘱咐他们，不可将这事告诉人； And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 又说：“人子必须受许多的苦，被长老、祭司长和文士弃绝，并且被杀，第三日复活。” Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 耶稣又对众人说：“若有人要跟从我，就当舍己，天天背起他的十字架来跟从我。 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 因为凡要救自己生命的(“生命”或作“灵魂”。下同。)，必丧掉生命；凡为我丧掉生命的，必救了生命。 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 人若赚得全世界，却丧了自己，赔上自己，有什么益处呢？ For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 凡把我和我的道当作可耻的，人子在自己的荣耀里，并天父与圣天使的荣耀里降临的时候，也要把那人当作可耻的。 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 我实在告诉你们，站在这里的，有人在没尝死味以前必看见　神的国。” But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 说了这话以后约有八天，耶稣带着彼得、约翰、雅各上山去祷告。 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 正祷告的时候，他的面貌就改变了，衣服洁白放光。 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 忽然有摩西、以利亚两个人同耶稣说话； And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 他们在荣光里显现，谈论耶稣去世的事，就是他在耶路撒冷将要成的事。 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 彼得和他的同伴都打盹，既清醒了，就看见耶稣的荣光，并同他站着的那两个人。 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 二人正要和耶稣分离的时候，彼得对耶稣说：“夫子，我们在这里真好！可以搭三座棚；一座为你，一座为摩西，一座为以利亚。”他却不知道所说的是什么。 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 说这话的时候，有一朵云彩来遮盖他们；他们进入云彩里就惧怕。 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 有声音从云彩里出来，说：“这是我的儿子，我所拣选的(有古卷作“这是我的爱子”)，你们要听他。” And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 声音住了，只见耶稣一人在那里。当那些日子，门徒不提所看见的事，一样也不告诉人。 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 第二天，他们下了山，就有许多人迎见耶稣。 And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 其中有一人喊叫说：“夫子！求你看顾我的儿子，因为他是我的独生子。 And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 他被鬼抓住，就忽然喊叫；鬼又叫他抽风，口中流沫，并且重重地伤害他，难以离开他。 And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 我求过你的门徒，把鬼赶出去，他们却是不能。” And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 耶稣说：“嗳！这又不信又悖谬的世代啊，我在你们这里，忍耐你们，要到几时呢？将你的儿子带到这里来吧！” And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 正来的时候，鬼把他摔倒，叫他重重地抽风。耶稣就斥责那污鬼，把孩子治好了，交给他父亲。 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 众人都诧异　神的大能(“大能”或作“威荣”)。耶稣所作的一切事，众人正希奇的时候，耶稣对门徒说： And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: “你们要把这些话存在耳中，因为人子将要被交在人手里。” Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 他们不明白这话，意思乃是隐藏的，叫他们不能明白，他们也不敢问这话的意思。 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 门徒中间起了议论，谁将为大。 Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 耶稣看出他们心中的议论，就领一个小孩子来，叫他站在自己旁边。 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 对他们说：“凡为我名接待这小孩子的，就是接待我；凡接待我的，就是接待那差我来的。你们中间最小的，他便为大。” And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 约翰说：“夫子，我们看见一个人奉你的名赶鬼，我们就禁止他；因为他不与我们一同跟从你。” And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 耶稣说：“不要禁止他；因为不敌挡你们的，就是帮助你们的。” And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: 耶稣被接上升的日子将到，他就定意向耶路撒冷去， And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">52: 便打发使者在他前头走。他们到了撒玛利亚的一个村庄，要为他预备。 And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">53: 那里的人不接待他，因他面向耶路撒冷去。 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">54: 他的门徒雅各、约翰看见了，就说：“主啊，你要我们吩咐火从天上降下来，烧灭他们，象以利亚所作的吗？(有古卷无“象以利亚所作的”数字)？” And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">55: 耶稣转身责备两个门徒，说：“你们的心如何，你们并不知道。 But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">56: 人子来不是要灭人的性命(“性命”或作“灵魂”。下同。)，是要救人的性命。”说着就往别的村庄去了(有古卷只有五十五节首句，五十六节末句。)。 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">57: 他们走路的时候，有一人对耶稣说：“你无论往哪里去，我要跟从你。” And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">58: 耶稣说：“狐狸有洞，天空的飞鸟有窝，只是人子没有枕头的地方。” And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">59: 又对一个人说：“跟从我来！”那人说：“主，容我先回去埋葬我的父亲。” And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">60: 耶稣说：“任凭死人埋葬他们的死人，你只管去传扬　神国的道。” Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">61: 又有一人说：“主，我要跟从你，但容我先去辞别我家里的人。” And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">62: 耶稣说：“手扶着犁向后看的，不配进　神的国。” And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor42_10">路加福音 10</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 这事以后，主又设立七十个人，差遣他们两个两个地在他前面，往自己所要到的各城各地方去； After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 就对他们说：“要收的庄稼多，作工的人少，所以你们当求庄稼的主打发工人出去收他的庄稼。 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 你们去吧！我差你们出去，如同羊羔进入狼群。 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 不要带钱囊，不要带口袋，不要带鞋；在路上也不要问人的安。 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 无论进哪一家，先要说：‘愿这一家平安。’ And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 那里若有当得平安的人(“当得平安的人”原文作“平安之子”)，你们所求的平安就必临到那家；不然，就归与你们了。 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 你们要住在那家，吃喝他们所供给的，因为工人得工价是应当的；不要从这家搬到那家。 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 无论进哪一城，人若接待你们，给你们摆上什么，你们就吃什么。 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 要医治那城里的病人，对他们说：‘　神的国临近你们了。’ And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 无论进哪一城，人若不接待你们，你们就到街上去， But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 说：‘就是你们城里的尘土粘在我们的脚上，我们也当着你们擦去；虽然如此，你们该知道　神的国临近了。’ Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 我告诉你们，当审判的日子，所多玛所受的，比那城还容易受呢！” But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: “哥拉汛哪，你有祸了！伯赛大啊，你有祸了！因为在你们中间所行的异能若行在推罗、西顿，他们早已披麻蒙灰，坐在地上悔改了。 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 当审判的日子，推罗、西顿所受的，比你们还容易受呢！ But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 迦百农啊，你已经升到天上(或作“你将要升到天上吗？”)，将来必推下阴间。” And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 又对门徒说：“听从你们的就是听从我；弃绝你们的就是弃绝我；弃绝我的就是弃绝那差我来的。” He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 那七十个人欢欢喜喜地回来，说：“主啊！因你的名，就是鬼也服了我们。” And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 耶稣对他们说：“我曾看见撒但从天上坠落，象闪电一样。 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 我已经给你们权柄可以践踏蛇和蝎子，又胜过仇敌一切的能力，断没有什么能害你们。 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 然而，不要因鬼服了你们就欢喜，要因你们的名记录在天上欢喜。” Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 正当那时，耶稣被圣灵感动就欢乐，说：“父啊，天地的主，我感谢你！因为你将这些事向聪明通达人就藏起来，向婴孩就显出来。父啊，是的，因为你的美意本是如此。 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 一切所有的，都是我父交付我的；除了父，没有人知道子是谁；除了子和子所愿意指示的，没有人知道父是谁。” All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 耶稣转身暗暗地对门徒说：“看见你们所看见的，那眼睛就有福了。 And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 我告诉你们，从前有许多先知和君王要看你们所看的，却没有看见；要听你们所听的，却没有听见。” For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 有一个律法师起来试探耶稣，说：“夫子！我该作什么才可以承受永生？” And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 耶稣对他说：“律法上写的是什么？你念的是怎样呢？” He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 他回答说：“你要尽心、尽性、尽力、尽意爱主你的　神；又要爱邻舍如同自己。” And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 耶稣说：“你回答的是；你这样行，就必得永生。” And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 那人要显明自己有理，就对耶稣说：“谁是我的邻舍呢？” But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 耶稣回答说：“有一个人从耶路撒冷下耶利哥去，落在强盗手中。他们剥去他的衣裳，把他打个半死，就丢下他走了。 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 偶然有一个祭司从这条路下来，看见他就从那边过去了。 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 又有一个利未人来到这地方，看见他，也照样从那边过去了。 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 惟有一个撒玛利亚人行路来到那里，看见他就动了慈心， But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 上前用油和酒倒在他的伤处，包裹好了，扶他骑上自己的牲口，带到店里去照应他。 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 第二天拿出二钱银子来，交给店主，说：‘你且照应他；此外所费用的，我回来必还你。’ And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 你想，这三个人哪一个是落在强盗手中的邻舍呢？” Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 他说：“是怜悯他的。”耶稣说：“你去照样行吧。” And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 他们走路的时候，耶稣进了一个村庄。有一个女人，名叫马大，接他到自己家里。 Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 她有一个妹子，名叫马利亚，在耶稣脚前坐着听他的道。 And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 马大伺候的事多，心里忙乱，就进前来，说：“主啊，我的妹子留下我一个人伺候，你不在意吗？请吩咐她来帮助我。” But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 耶稣回答说：“马大！马大！你为许多的事思虑烦扰； And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 但是不可少的只有一件；马利亚已经选择那上好的福分，是不能夺去的。” But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor42_11">路加福音 11</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶稣在一个地方祷告；祷告完了，有个门徒对他说：“求主教导我们祷告，象约翰教导他的门徒。” And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 耶稣说：“你们祷告的时候，要说：我们在天上的父(有古卷只作“父啊”)：愿人都尊你的名为圣。愿你的国降临；愿你的旨意行在地上，如同行在天上(有古卷无“愿你的旨意”云云)。 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 我们日用的饮食，天天赐给我们。 Give us day by day our daily bread.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 赦免我们的罪，因为我们也赦免凡亏欠我们的人。不叫我们遇见试探；救我们脱离凶恶(有古卷无末句)。” And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 耶稣又说：“你们中间谁有一个朋友半夜到他那里去，说：‘朋友！请借给我三个饼， And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 因为我有一个朋友行路，来到我这里，我没有什么给他摆上。’ For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 那人在里面回答说：‘不要搅扰我，门已经关闭，孩子们也同我在床上了，我不能起来给你。’ And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 我告诉你们，虽不因他是朋友起来给他，但因他情词迫切地直求，就必起来照他所需用的给他。 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 我又告诉你们，你们祈求，就给你们；寻找，就寻见；叩门，就给你们开门。 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 因为凡祈求的，就得着；寻找的，就寻见；叩门的，就给他开门。 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 你们中间作父亲的，谁有儿子求饼，反给他石头呢？求鱼，反拿蛇当鱼给他呢？ If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 求鸡蛋，反给他蝎子呢？ Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 你们虽然不好，尚且知道拿好东西给儿女；何况天父，岂不更将圣灵给求他的人吗？” If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 耶稣赶出一个叫人哑巴的鬼；鬼出去了，哑巴就说出话来；众人都希奇。 And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 内中却有人说：“他是靠着鬼王别西卜赶鬼。” But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 又有人试探耶稣，向他求从天上来的神迹。 And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 他晓得他们的意念，便对他们说：“凡一国自相纷争，就成为荒场；凡一家自相纷争，就必败落。 But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 若撒但自相纷争，他的国怎能站得住呢？因为你们说我是靠着别西卜赶鬼。 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 我若靠着别西卜赶鬼，你们的子弟赶鬼，又靠着谁呢？这样，他们就要断定你们的是非。 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 我若靠着　神的能力赶鬼，这就是　神的国临到你们了。 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 壮士披挂整齐，看守自己的住宅，他所有的都平安无事； When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 但有一个比他更壮的来，胜过他，就夺去他所倚靠的盔甲兵器，又分了他的赃。 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 不与我相合的，就是敌我的；不同我收聚的，就是分散的。 He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: “污鬼离了人身，就在无水之地过来过去，寻求安歇之处；既寻不着，便说：‘我要回到我所出来的屋里去。’ When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 到了，就看见里面打扫干净，修饰好了； And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 便去另带了七个比自己更恶的鬼来，都进去住在那里。那人末后的景况，比先前更不好了。” Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 耶稣正说这话的时候，众人中间，有一个女人大声说：“怀你胎的和乳养你的有福了！” And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 耶稣说：“是，却还不如听　神之道而遵守的人有福。” But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 当众人聚集的时候，耶稣开讲说：“这世代是一个邪恶的世代；他们求看神迹，除了约拿的神迹以外，再没有神迹给他们看。 And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 约拿怎样为尼尼微人成了神迹，人子也要照样为这世代的人成了神迹。 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 当审判的时候，南方的女王要起来定这世代的罪；因为她从地极而来，要听所罗门的智慧话。看哪！在这里有一人比所罗门更大。 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 当审判的时候，尼尼微人要起来定这世代的罪，因为尼尼微人听了约拿所传的就悔改了。看哪！在这里有一人比约拿更大。 The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: “没有人点灯放在地窨子里，或是斗底下，总是放在灯台上，使进来的人得见亮光。 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 你眼睛就是身上的灯。你的眼睛若了亮，全身就光明；眼睛若昏花，全身就黑暗。 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 所以，你要省察，恐怕你里头的光或者黑暗了。 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 若是你全身光明，毫无黑暗，就必全然光明，如同灯的明光照亮你。” If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 说话的时候，有一个法利赛人请耶稣同他吃饭；耶稣就进去坐席。 And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 这法利赛人看见耶稣饭前不洗手便诧异。 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 主对他说：“如今你们法利赛人洗净杯盘的外面，你们里面却满了勒索和邪恶。 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 无知的人哪！造外面的，不也造里面吗？ Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 只要把里面的施舍给人，凡物于你们就都洁净了。 But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: “你们法利赛人有祸了！因为你们将薄荷、芸香并各样菜蔬献上十分之一，那公义和爱　神的事反倒不行了。这原是你们当行的，那也是不可不行的。 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 你们法利赛人有祸了！因为你们喜爱会堂里的首位，又喜爱人在街市上问你们的安。 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 你们有祸了！因为你们如同不显露的坟墓，走在上面的人并不知道。” Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 律法师中有一个回答耶稣说：“夫子！你这样说也把我们糟蹋了。” Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 耶稣说：“你们律法师也有祸了！因为你们把难担的担子放在人身上，自己一个指头却不肯动。 And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 你们有祸了！因为你们修造先知的坟墓，那先知正是你们的祖宗所杀的。 Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 可见你们祖宗所作的事，你们又证明又喜欢；因为他们杀了先知，你们修造先知的坟墓。 Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 所以，　神用智慧曾说(“用智慧”或作“的智者”)：‘我要差遣先知和使徒到他们那里去，有的他们要杀害，有的他们要逼迫。’ Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 使创世以来，所流众先知血的罪，都要问在这世代的人身上； That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: 就是从亚伯的血起，直到被杀在坛和殿中间撒迦利亚的血为止。我实在告诉你们，这都要问在这世代的人身上。 From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">52: 你们律法师有祸了！因为你们把知识的钥匙夺了去。自己不进去，正要进去的人，你们也阻挡他们。” Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">53: 耶稣从那里出来，文士和法利赛人就极力地催逼他，引动他多说话， And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">54: 私下窥听，要拿他的话柄。 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor42_12">路加福音 12</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 这时，有几万人聚集，甚至彼此践踏。耶稣开讲，先对门徒说：“你们要防备法利赛人的酵，就是假冒为善。 In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 掩盖的事，没有不露出来的；隐藏的事，没有不被人知道的。 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 因此，你们在暗中所说的，将要在明处被人听见；在内室附耳所说的，将要在房上被人宣扬。 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: “我的朋友，我对你们说，那杀身体以后不能再作什么的，不要怕他们。 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 我要指示你们当怕的是谁；当怕那杀了以后又有权柄丢在地狱里的。我实在告诉你们，正要怕他。 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 五个麻雀不是卖二分银子吗？但在　神面前，一个也不忘记； Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 就是你们的头发，也都被数过了。不要惧怕，你们比许多麻雀还贵重。 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: “我又告诉你们，凡在人面前认我的，人子在　神的使者面前也必认他； Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 在人面前不认我的，人子在　神的使者面前也必不认他。 But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 凡说话干犯人子的，还可得赦免；惟独亵渎圣灵的，总不得赦免。 And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 人带你们到会堂，并官府，和有权柄的人面前，不要思虑怎么分诉，说什么话； And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 因为正在那时候，圣灵要指教你们当说的话。” For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 众人中有一个人对耶稣说：“夫子！请你吩咐我的兄长和我分开家业。” And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 耶稣说：“你这个人！谁立我作你们断事的官，给你们分家业呢？” And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 于是对众人说：“你们要谨慎自守，免去一切的贪心，因为人的生命不在乎家道丰富。” And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 就用比喻对他们说：“有一个财主田产丰盛； And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 自己心里思想说：‘我的出产没有地方收藏，怎么办呢？’ And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 又说：‘我要这么办：要把我的仓房拆了，另盖更大的，在那里好收藏我一切的粮食和财物。 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 然后要对我的灵魂说：灵魂哪！你有许多财物积存，可作多年的费用，只管安安逸逸地吃喝快乐吧。’ And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 　神却对他说：‘无知的人哪！今夜必要你的灵魂；你所预备的要归谁呢？’ But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 凡为自己积财，在　神面前却不富足的，也是这样。” So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 耶稣又对门徒说：“所以我告诉你们，不要为生命忧虑吃什么，为身体忧虑穿什么； And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 因为生命胜于饮食，身体胜于衣裳。 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 你想乌鸦：也不种，也不收，又没有仓，又没有库，　神尚且养活它。你们比飞鸟是何等地贵重呢！ Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 你们哪一个能用思虑使寿数多加一刻呢(或作“使身量多加一肘呢”)？ And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 这最小的事，你们尚且不能作，为什么还忧虑其余的事呢？ If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 你想百合花：怎么长起来；它也不劳苦，也不纺线。然而我告诉你们，就是所罗门极荣华的时候，他所穿戴的，还不如这花一朵呢！ Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 你们这小信的人哪！野地里的草，今天还在，明天就丢在炉里，　神还给它这样的妆饰，何况你们呢！ If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 你们不要求吃什么，喝什么，也不要挂心。 And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 这都是外邦人所求的；你们必须用这些东西，你们的父是知道的。 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 你们只要求他的国，这些东西就必加给你们了。 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 你们这小群，不要惧怕，因为你们的父，乐意把国赐给你们。 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 你们要变卖所有的周济人，为自己预备永不坏的钱囊，用不尽的财宝在天上，就是贼不能近，虫不能蛀的地方。 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 因为你们的财宝在哪里，你们的心也在哪里。 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: “你们腰里要束上带，灯也要点着， Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 自己好象仆人等候主人从婚姻的筵席上回来。他来到，叩门，就立刻给他开门。 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 主人来了；看见仆人警醒，那仆人就有福了。我实在告诉你们，主人必叫他们坐席，自己束上带，进前伺候他们。 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 或是二更天来，或是三更天来，看见仆人这样，那仆人就有福了。 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 家主若知道贼什么时候来，就必警醒，不容贼挖透房屋，这是你们所知道的。 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 你们也要预备，因为你们想不到的时候，人子就来了。” Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 彼得说：“主啊，这比喻是为我们说的呢？还是为众人呢？” Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 主说：“谁是那忠心有见识的管家，主人派他管理家里的人，按时分粮给他们呢？ And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 主人来到，看见仆人这样行，那仆人就有福了。 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 我实在告诉你们，主人要派他管理一切所有的。 Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 那仆人若心里说：‘我的主人必来得迟，’就动手打仆人和使女，并且吃喝醉酒； But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 在他想不到的日子，不知道的时辰，那仆人的主人要来，重重地处治他(或作“把他腰斩了”)，定他和不忠心的人同罪。 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 仆人知道主人的意思，却不预备，又不顺他的意思行，那仆人必多受责打； And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 惟有那不知道的，作了当受责打的事，必少受责打；因为多给谁，就向谁多取；多托谁，就向谁多要。 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: “我来要把火丢在地上；倘若已经着起来，不也是我所愿意的吗？ I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 我有当受的洗还没有成就，我是何等的迫切呢？ But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: 你们以为我来，是叫地上太平吗？我告诉你们，不是，乃是叫人纷争。 Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">52: 从今以后，一家五个人将要纷争：三个人和两个人相争，两个人和三个人相争； For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">53: 父亲和儿子相争，儿子和父亲相争；母亲和女儿相争，女儿和母亲相争；婆婆和媳妇相争，媳妇和婆婆相争。” The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">54: 耶稣又对众人说：“你们看见西边起了云彩，就说：‘要下一阵雨；’果然就有。 And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">55: 起了南风，就说：‘将要燥热；’也就有了。 And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">56: 假冒为善的人哪！你们知道分辨天地的气色，怎么不知道分辨这时候呢？ Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">59: 我告诉你，若有半文钱没有还清，你断不能从那里出来。” I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor42_13">路加福音 13</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 耶稣说：“你们以为这些加利利人比众加利利人更有罪，所以受这害吗？ And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 我告诉你们，不是的！你们若不悔改，都要如此灭亡！ I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 从前西罗亚楼倒塌了，压死十八个人；你们以为那些人比一切住在耶路撒冷的人更有罪吗？ Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 就对管园的说：‘看哪！我这三年来到这无花果树前找果子，竟找不着。把它砍了吧，何必白占地土呢！’ Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 管园的说：‘主啊，今年且留着，等我周围掘开土，加上粪； And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 有一个女人被鬼附着，病了十八年，腰弯得一点直不起来。 And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 耶稣看见，便叫过她来，对她说：“女人，你脱离这病了！” And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 于是用两只手按着她；她立刻直起腰来，就归荣耀与　神。 And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 管会堂的因为耶稣在安息日治病，就气忿忿地对众人说：“有六日应当作工；那六日之内可以来求医，在安息日却不可。” And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 主说：“假冒为善的人哪！难道你们各人在安息日不解开槽上的牛驴，牵去饮吗？ The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 况且这女人本是亚伯拉罕的后裔，被撒但捆绑了这十八年，不当在安息日解开她的绑吗？” And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 耶稣说这话，他的敌人都惭愧了；众人因他所行一切荣耀的事，就都欢喜了。 And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 耶稣说：“　神的国好象什么？我拿什么来比较呢？ Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 好象一粒芥菜种，有人拿去种在园子里，长大成树，天上的飞鸟宿在它的枝上。” It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 又说：“我拿什么来比　神的国呢？ And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 好比面酵，有妇人拿来藏在三斗面里，直等全团都发起来。” It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 耶稣往耶路撒冷去，在所经过的各城各乡教训人。 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 有一个人问他说：“主啊！得救的人少吗？” Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 耶稣对众人说：“你们要努力进窄门。我告诉你们，将来有许多人想要进去，却是不能。 Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 及至家主起来关了门，你们站在外面叩门，说：‘主啊，给我们开门！’他就回答说：‘我不认识你们，不晓得你们是哪里来的！’ When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 那时，你们要说：‘我们在你面前吃过喝过，你也在我们的街上教训过人。’ Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 他要说：‘我告诉你们，我不晓得你们是哪里来的。你们这一切作恶的人，离开我去吧！’ But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 你们要看见亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各和众先知，都在　神的国里，你们却被赶到外面，在那里必要哀哭切齿了。 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 从东、从西、从南、从北将有人来，在　神的国里坐席。 And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 只是有在后的，将要在前；有在前的，将要在后。” And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 正当那时，有几个法利赛人来对耶稣说：“离开这里去吧，因为希律想要杀你。” The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 耶稣说：“你们去告诉那个狐狸说：‘今天明天我赶鬼治病，第三天我的事就成全了。’ And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 虽然这样，今天明天后天我必须前行；因为先知在耶路撒冷之外丧命是不能的。 Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 耶路撒冷啊！耶路撒冷啊！你常杀害先知，又用石头打死那奉差遣到你这里来的人。我多次愿意聚集你的儿女，好象母鸡把小鸡聚集在翅膀底下，只是你们不愿意。 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 看哪！你们的家成为荒场，留给你们。我告诉你们，从今以后，你们不得再见我，直等到你们说：‘奉主名来的，是应当称颂的。’” Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor42_14">路加福音 14</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 安息日，耶稣到一个法利赛人的首领家里去吃饭，他们就窥探他。 And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 在他面前有一个患水臌的人。 And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 耶稣对律法师和法利赛人说：“安息日治病，可以不可以？” And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他们却不言语。耶稣就治好那人，叫他走了； And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 便对他们说：“你们中间谁有驴或有牛，在安息日掉在井里，不立时拉它上来呢？” And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他们不能对答这话。 And they could not answer him again to these things.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 耶稣见所请的客拣择首位，就用比喻对他们说： And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: “你被人请去赴婚姻的筵席，不要坐在首位上，恐怕有比你尊贵的客，被他请来； When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 那请你们的人前来对你说：‘让座给这一位吧。’你就羞羞惭惭地退到末位上去了。 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 你被请的时候，就去坐在末位上，好叫那请你的人来对你说：‘朋友，请上座。’那时，你在同席的人面前就有光彩了。 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 因为凡自高的，必降为卑；自卑的，必升为高。” For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 耶稣又对请他的人说：“你摆设午饭或晚饭，不要请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属，和富足的邻舍，恐怕他们也请你，你就得了报答。 Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 你摆设筵席，倒要请那贫穷的、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的，你就有福了！ But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 因为他们没有什么可报答你。到义人复活的时候，你要得着报答。” And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 同席的有一人听见这话，就对耶稣说：“在　神国里吃饭的有福了！” And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 耶稣对他说：“有一人摆设大筵席，请了许多客。 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 到了坐席的时候，打发仆人去对所请的人说：‘请来吧！样样都齐备了。’ And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 众人一口同音地推辞。头一个说：‘我买了一块地，必须去看看。请你准我辞了。’ And they all with one consent began to make excuse.

thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 打发的人去了，所遇见的，正如耶稣所说的。 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 他们解驴驹的时候，主人问他们说：“解驴驹作什么？” And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 他们说：“主要用它。” And they said, The Lord hath need of him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 他们牵到耶稣那里，把自己的衣服搭在上面，扶着耶稣骑上。 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 走的时候，众人把衣服铺在路上。 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 将近耶路撒冷，正下橄榄山的时候，众门徒因所见过的一切异能，都欢乐起来，大声赞美　神， And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 说：“奉主名来的王，是应当称颂的！在天上有和平；在至高之处有荣光。” Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 众人中有几个法利赛人对耶稣说：“夫子，责备你的门徒吧！” And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 耶稣说：“我告诉你们，若是他们闭口不说，这些石头必要呼叫起来。” And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 耶稣快到耶路撒冷，看见城，就为它哀哭， And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 说：“巴不得你在这日子知道关系你平安的事；无奈这事现在是隐藏的，叫你的眼看不出来。 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 因为日子将到，你的仇敌必筑起土垒，周围环绕你，四面困住你， For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 并要扫灭你，和你里头的儿女，连一块石头也不留在石头上；因你不知道眷顾你的时候。” And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 耶稣进了殿，赶出里头作买卖的人， And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 对他们说：“经上说：‘我的殿必作祷告的殿’；你们倒使它成为贼窝了。” Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 耶稣天天在殿里教训人。祭司长和文士与百姓的尊长都想要杀他。 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 但寻不出法子来，因为百姓都侧耳听他。 And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor42_20">路加福音 20</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 有一天，耶稣在殿里教训百姓，讲福音的时候，祭司长和文士并长老上前来， And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 问他说：“你告诉我们，你仗着什么权柄作这些事？给你这权柄的是谁呢？” And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 耶稣回答说：“我也要问你们一句话，你们且告诉我。 And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 约翰的洗礼是从天上来的？是从人间来的呢？” The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他们彼此商议说：“我们若说：‘从天上来，’他必说‘你们为什么不信他呢？’ And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 若说‘从人间来，’百姓都要用石头打死我们，因为他们信约翰是先知。” But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 于是回答说：“不知道是从哪里来的。” And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 耶稣说：“我也不告诉你们，我仗着什么权柄作这些事。” And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 耶稣就设比喻对百姓说：“有人栽了一个葡萄园，租给园户，就往外国去住了许久。 Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 到了时候，打发一个仆人到园户那里去，叫他们把园中当纳的果子交给他；园户竟打了他，叫他空手回去。 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 又打发一个仆人去，他们也打了他，并且凌辱他，叫他空手回去。 And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 又打发第三个仆人去。他们也打伤了他，把他推出去了。 And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 园主说：‘我怎么办呢？我要打发我的爱子去，或者他们尊敬他。’ Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 不料，园户看见他，就彼此商量说：‘这是承受产业的，我们杀他吧，使产业归于我们！’ But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 于是把他推出葡萄园外，杀了。这样，葡萄园的主人，要怎样处治他们呢？ So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 他要来除灭这些园户，将葡萄园转给别人。”听见的人说：“这是万不可的。” He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 耶稣看着他们说：“经上记着：‘匠人所弃的石头已作了房角的头块石头。’这是什么意思呢？ And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 凡掉在那石头上的，必要跌碎；那石头掉在谁的身上，就要把谁砸得稀烂。” Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 文士和祭司长看出这比喻是指着他们说的，当时就想要下手拿他，只是惧怕百姓。 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 于是窥探耶稣，打发奸细装作好人，要在他的话上得把柄，好将他交在巡抚的政权之下。 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 奸细就问耶稣说：“夫子，我们晓得你所讲所传都是正道，也不取人的外貌，乃是诚诚实实传　神的道。 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 我们纳税给凯撒，可以不可以？” Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 耶稣看出他们的诡诈，就对他们说： But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: “拿一个银钱来给我看。这像和这号是谁的？”他们说：“是凯撒的。” Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 耶稣说：“这样，凯撒的物当归给凯撒，　神的物当归给　神。” And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 他们当着百姓，在这话上得不着把柄，又希奇他的应对，就闭口无言了。 And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 撒都该人常说没有复活的事。有几个来问耶稣说： Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: “夫子，摩西为我们写着说：‘人若有妻无子就死了，他兄弟当娶他的妻，为哥哥生子立后。’ Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 有弟兄七人，第一个娶了妻，没有孩子死了； There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 第二个、第三个也娶过她； And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 那七个人都娶过她，没有留下孩子就死了。 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 后来妇人也死了。 Last of all the woman died also.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 这样，当复活的时候，她是哪一个的妻子呢？因为他们七个人都娶过她。” Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 耶稣说：“这世界的人有娶有嫁； And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 惟有算为配得那世界，与从死里复活的人，也不娶也不嫁； But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 因为他们不能再死，和天使一样；既是复活的人，就为　神的儿子。 Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 至于死人复活，摩西在荆棘篇上，称主是亚伯拉罕的　神，以撒的　神，雅各的　神，就指示明白了。 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 　神原不是死人的　神，乃是活人的　神；因为在他那里，人都是活的(“那里”或作“看来”)。” For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 有几个文士说：“夫子！你说得好。” Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 以后他们不敢再问他什么。 And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 耶稣对他们说：“人怎么说基督是大卫的子孙呢？ And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 诗篇上大卫自己说：‘主对我主说：你坐在我的右边， And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 等我使你仇敌作你的脚凳。’ Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 大卫既称他为主，他怎么又是大卫的子孙呢？” David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 众百姓听的时候，耶稣对门徒说： Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: “你们要防备文士。他们好穿长衣游行，喜爱人在街市上问他们安，又喜爱会堂里的高位，筵席上的首座； Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 他们侵吞寡妇的家产，假意作很长的祷告。这些人要受更重的刑罚。” Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor42_21">路加福音 21</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶稣抬头观看，见财主把捐项投在库里； And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 又见一个穷寡妇，投了两个小钱； And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 就说：“我实在告诉你们，这穷寡妇所投的比众人还多； And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 因为众人都是自己有余，拿出来投在捐项里，但这寡妇是自己不足，把她一切养生的都投上了。” For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 有人谈论圣殿是用美石和供物妆饰的； And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 耶稣就说：“论到你们所看见的这一切，将来日子到了，在这里没有一块石头留在石头上，不被拆毁了。” As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 他们问他说：“夫子！什么时候有这事呢？这事将到的时候，有什么预兆呢？” And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 耶稣说：“你们要谨慎，不要受迷惑，因为将来有好些人冒我的名来，说：‘我是基督，’又说：‘时候近了！’你们不要跟从他们。 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 你们听见打仗和扰乱的事，不要惊惶；因为这些事必须先有，只是末期不能立时就到。” But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 当时耶稣对他们说：“民要攻打民，国要攻打国， Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 地要大大震动，多处必有饥荒、瘟疫，又有可怕的异象和大神迹，从天上显现。 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 但这一切的事以先，人要下手拿住你们，逼迫你们，把你们交给会堂，并且收在监里，又为我的名拉你们到君王诸侯面前。 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 但这些事终必为你们的见证。 And it shall turn to you for a testimony.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 所以，你们当立定心意，不要预先思想怎样分诉； Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 因为我必赐你们口才智慧，是你们一切敌人所敌不住、驳不倒的。 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 连你们的父母、弟兄、亲族、朋友也要把你们交官；你们也有被他们害死的。 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 你们要为我的名被众人恨恶， And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 然而，你们连一根头发也必不损坏。 But there shall not an hair of your head perish.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 你们常存忍耐，就必保全灵魂(或作“必得生命”)。 In your patience possess ye your souls.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: “你们看见耶路撒冷被兵围困，就可知道它成荒场的日子近了。 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 那时，在犹太的应当逃到山上；在城里的应当出来；在乡下的不要进城； Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 因为这是报应的日子，使经上所写的都得应验。 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 当那些日子，怀孕的和奶孩子的有祸了！因为将有大灾难降在这地方，也有震怒临到这百姓。 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 他们要倒在刀下，又被掳到各国去。耶路撒冷要被外邦人践踏，直到外邦人的日期满了。 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: “日月星辰要显出异兆，地上的邦国也有困苦；因海中波浪的响声，就慌慌不定。 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 天势都要震动，人想起那将要临到世界的事，就都吓得魂不附体。 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 那时，他们要看见人子有能力、有大荣耀驾云降临。 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 一有这些事，你们就当挺身昂首，因为你们得赎的日子近了。” And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: - And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 耶稣又设比喻对他们说：“你们看无花果树和各样的树；它发芽的时候，你们一看见，自然晓得夏天近了。 When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 这样，你们看见这些事渐渐地成就，也该晓得　神的国近了。 So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 我实在告诉你们，这世代还没有过去，这些事都要成就。 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 天地要废去，我的话却不能废去。 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: “你们要谨慎，恐怕因贪食、醉酒，并今生的思虑累住你们的心，那日子就如同网罗忽然临到你们； And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 因为那日子要这样临到全地上一切居住的人。 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 你们要时时警醒，常常祈求，使你们能逃避这一切要来的事，得以站立在人子面前。” Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 耶稣每日在殿里教训人，每夜出城在一座山名叫橄榄山住宿。 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 众百姓清早上圣殿，到耶稣那里，要听他讲道。 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor42_22">路加福音 22</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 除酵节，又名逾越节，近了。 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 祭司长和文士想法子怎么才能杀害耶稣，是因他们惧怕百姓。 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 这时，撒但入了那称为加略人犹大的心，他本是十二门徒里的一个。 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他去和祭司长并守殿官商量，怎么可以把耶稣交给他们。 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他们欢喜，就约定给他银子。 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他应允了，就找机会，要趁众人不在跟前的时候，把耶稣交给他们。 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 除酵节，须宰逾越羊羔的那一天到了。 Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 耶稣打发彼得、约翰说：“你们去为我们预备逾越节的筵席，好叫我们吃。” And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他们问他说：“要我们在哪里预备？” And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 耶稣说：“你们进了城，必有人拿着一瓶水迎面而来，你们就跟着他，到他所进的房子里去。 And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 对那家的主人说：‘夫子说：客房在哪里？我与门徒好在那里吃逾越节的筵席。’ And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 时候到了，耶稣坐席，使徒也和他同坐。 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 耶稣对他们说：“我很愿意在受害以先和你们吃这逾越节的筵席。 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 我告诉你们，我不再吃这筵席，直到成就在　神的国里。” For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 耶稣接过杯来，祝谢了，说：“你们拿这个，大家分着喝。 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 我告诉你们，从今以后，我不再喝这葡萄汁，直等　神的国来到。” For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 又拿起饼来，祝谢了，就掰开，递给他们，说：“这是我的身体，为你们舍的，你们也应当如此行，为的是记念我。” And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 饭后也照样拿起杯来，说：“这杯是用我血所立的新约，是为你们流出来的。 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 看哪！那卖我之人的手与我一同在桌子上。 But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 人子固然要照所预定的去世，但卖人子的人有祸了！” And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 他们就彼此对问，是哪一个要作这事。 And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 门徒起了争论，他们中间哪一个可算为大。 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 耶稣说：“外邦人有君王为主治理他们，那掌权管他们的称为恩主。 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 但你们不可这样；你们里头为大的，倒要象年幼的；为首领的，倒要象服事人的。 But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 是谁为大？是坐席的呢？是服事人的呢？不是坐席的大吗？然而我在你们中间，如同服事人的。 For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 我在磨炼之中，常和我同在的就是你们。 Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 我将国赐给你们，正如我父赐给我一样， And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 叫你们在我国里，坐在我的席上吃喝；并且坐在宝座上，审判以色列十二个支派。” That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 主又说：“西门！西门！撒但想要得着你们，好筛你们象筛麦子一样； And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 但我已经为你祈求，叫你不至于失了信心，你回头以后，要坚固你的弟兄。” But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 彼得说：“主啊！我就是同你下监，同你受死，也是甘心。” And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 耶稣说：“彼得，我告诉你，今日鸡还没有叫，你要三次说不认得我。” And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 耶稣又对他们说：“我差你们出去的时候，没有钱囊，没有口袋，没有鞋，你们缺少什么没有？”他们说：“没有。” And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 耶稣说：“但如今有钱囊的可以带着，有口袋的也可以带着，没有刀的要卖衣服买刀。 Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 我告诉你们，经上写着说：‘他被列在罪犯之中。’这话必应验在我身上；因为那关系我的事，必然成就。” For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 他们说：“主啊，请看！这里有两把刀。”耶稣说：“够了。” And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 耶稣出来，照常往橄榄山去。门徒也跟随他。 And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 到了那地方，就对他们说：“你们要祷告，免得入了迷惑。” And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 于是离开他们约有扔一块石头那么远，跪下祷告， And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 说：“父啊！你若愿意，就把这杯撤去；然而不要成就我的意思，只要成就你的意思。” Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 有一位天使，从天上显现，加添他的力量。 And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 耶稣极其伤痛，祷告更加恳切，汗珠如大血点，滴在地上。 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 祷告完了，就起来，到门徒那里，见他们因为忧愁都睡着了， And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 就对他们说：“你们为什么睡觉呢？起来祷告！免得入了迷惑。” And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 说话之间，来了许多人。那十二个门徒里名叫犹大的，走在前头，就近耶稣，要与他亲嘴。 And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 耶稣对他说：“犹大！你用亲嘴的暗号卖人子吗？” But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 左右的人见光景不好，就说：“主啊！我们拿刀砍可以不可以？” When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 内中有一个人把大祭司的仆人砍了一刀，削掉了他的右耳。 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: 耶稣说：“到了这个地步，由他们吧！”就摸那人的耳朵，把他治好了。 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">52: 耶稣对那些来拿他的祭司长和守殿官并长老说：“你们带着刀棒出来拿我，如同拿强盗吗？ Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">53: 我天天同你们在殿里，你们不下手拿我。现在却是你们的时候，黑暗掌权了。” When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">54: 他们拿住耶稣，把他带到大祭司的宅里。彼得远远地跟着。 Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">55: 他们在院子里生了火，一同坐着；彼得也坐在他们中间。 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">56: 有一个使女，看见彼得坐在火光里，就定睛看他，说：“这个人素来也是同那人一伙的。” But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">57: 彼得却不承认，说：“女子，我不认得他。” And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">58: 过了不多的时候，又有一个人看见他，说：“你也是他们一党的。”彼得说：“你这个人！我不是。” And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">59: 约过了一小时，又有一个人极力地说：“他实在是同那人一伙的，因为他也是加利利人。” And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">60: 彼得说：“你这个人！我不晓得你说的是什么。”正说话之间，鸡就叫了。 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">61: 主转过身来看彼得。彼得便想起主对他所说的话：“今日鸡叫以先，你要三次不认我。” And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">62: 他就出去痛哭。 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">63: 看守耶稣的人戏弄他，打他， And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">64: 又蒙着他的眼，问他说：“你是先知，告诉我们打你的是谁？” And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">65: 他们还用许多别的话辱骂他。 And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">66: 天一亮，民间的众长老连祭司长带文士都聚会，把耶稣带到他们的公会里， And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">67: 说：“你若是基督，就告诉我们。”耶稣说：“我若告诉你们，你们也不信； Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">68: 我若问你们，你们也不回答。 And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">69: 从今以后，人子要坐在　神权能的右边。” Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">70: 他们都说：“这样，你是　神的儿子吗？”耶稣说：“你们所说的是。” Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">71: 他们说：“何必再用见证呢？他亲口所说的，我们都亲自听见了。” And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor42_23">路加福音 23</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 众人都起来，把耶稣解到彼拉多面前， And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 就告他说：“我们见这人诱惑国民，禁止纳税给凯撒，并说自己是基督，是王。” And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 彼拉多问耶稣说：“你是犹太人的王吗？”耶稣回答说：“你说的是。” And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 彼拉多对祭司长和众人说：“我查不出这人有什么罪来。” Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 但他们越发极力地说：“他煽惑百姓，在犹太遍地传道，从加利利起，直到这里了。” And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 彼拉多一听见，就问：“这人是加利利人吗？” When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 既晓得耶稣属希律所管，就把他送到希律那里去。那时希律正在耶路撒冷。 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 希律看见耶稣，就很欢喜，因为听见过他的事，久已想要见他，并且指望看他行一件神迹。 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 于是问他许多的话；耶稣却一言不答。 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 祭司长和文士都站着，极力地告他。 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 希律和他的兵丁就藐视耶稣，戏弄他，给他穿上华丽衣服，把他送回彼拉多那里去。 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 从前希律和彼拉多彼此有仇，在那一天就成了朋友。 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 彼拉多传齐了祭司长和官府并百姓， And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 就对他们说：“你们解这人到我这里，说他是诱惑百姓的。看哪！我也曾将你们告他的事，在你们面前审问他，并没有查出他什么罪来； Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 就是希律也是如此，所以把他送回来。可见他没有作什么该死的事； No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 故此，我要责打他，把他释放了。”(有古卷在此有 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: “每逢这节期，巡抚必须释放一个囚犯给他们。”) (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 众人却一齐喊着说：“除掉这个人！释放巴拉巴给我们！” And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 这巴拉巴是因在城里作乱杀人，下在监里的。 (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 彼拉多愿意释放耶稣，就又劝解他们。 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 无奈他们喊着说：“钉他十字架！钉他十字架！” But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 彼拉多第三次对他们说：“为什么呢？这人作了什么恶事呢？我并没有查出他什么该死的罪来。所以，我要责打他，把他释放了。” And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 他们大声催逼彼拉多，求他把耶稣钉在十字架上；他们的声音就得了胜。 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 彼拉多这才照他们所求的定案， And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 把他们所求的，那作乱杀人下在监里的，释放了；把耶稣交给他们，任凭他们的意思行。 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 带耶稣去的时候，有一个古利奈人西门，从乡下来；他们就抓住他，把十字架搁在他身上，叫他背着跟随耶稣。 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 有许多百姓跟随耶稣，内中有好些妇女；妇女们为他号咷痛哭。 And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 耶稣转身对她们说：“耶路撒冷的女子，不要为我哭，当为自己和自己的儿女哭。 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 因为日子要到，人必说：‘不生育的和未曾怀胎的，未曾乳养婴孩的，有福了！’ For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 那时，人要向大山说：‘倒在我们身上！’向小山说：‘遮盖我们！’ Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 这些事既行在有汁水的树上，那枯干的树将来怎么样呢？” For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 又有两个犯人，和耶稣一同带来处死。 And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 到了一个地方，名叫髑髅地，就在那里把耶稣钉在十字架上，又钉了两个犯人：一个在左边，一个在右边。 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 当下耶稣说：“父啊！赦免他们，因为他们所作的，他们不晓得。”兵丁就拈阄分他的衣服。 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 百姓站在那里观看。官府也嗤笑他，说：“他救了别人；他若是基督，　神所拣选的，可以救自己吧！” And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 兵丁也戏弄他，上前拿醋送给他喝， And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 说：“你若是犹太人的王，可以救自己吧！” And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 在耶稣以上有一个牌子(有古卷在此有“用希腊、罗马、希伯来的文字”)写着：“这是犹太人的王。” And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 那同钉的两个犯人，有一个讥诮他，说：“你不是基督吗？可以救自己和我们吧！” And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 那一个就应声责备他，说：“你既是一样受刑的，还不怕　神吗？ But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 我们是应该的，因我们所受的，与我们所作的相称；但这个人没有作过一件不好的事；” And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 就说：“耶稣啊！你得国降临的时候，求你记念我。” And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 耶稣对他说：“我实在告诉你，今日你要同我在乐园里了。” And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 那时约有午正，遍地都黑暗了，直到申初， And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 日头变黑了；殿里的幔子从当中裂为两半。 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 耶稣大声喊着说：“父啊！我将我的灵魂交在你手里。”说了这话，气就断了。 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 百夫长看见所成的事，就归荣耀与　神，说：“这真是个义人！” Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 聚集观看的众人见了这所成的事，都捶着胸回去了。 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 还有一切与耶稣熟识的人，和从加利利跟着他来的妇女们，都远远地站着看这些事。 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 有一个人名叫约瑟，是个议士，为人善良公义； And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: 众人所谋所为，他并没有附从。他本是犹太亚利马太城里素常盼望　神国的人。 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">52: 这人去见彼拉多，求耶稣的身体； This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">53: 就取下来用细麻布裹好，安放在石头凿成的坟墓里，那里头从来没有葬过人。 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">54: 那日是预备日，安息日也快到了。 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">55: 那些从加利利和耶稣同来的妇女跟在后面，看见了坟墓和他的身体怎样安放。 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">56: 她们就回去，预备了香料香膏。她们在安息日，便遵着诫命安息了。 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor42_24">路加福音 24</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 七日的头一日，黎明的时候，那些妇女带着所预备的香料来到坟墓前， Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 看见石头已经从坟墓辊开了， And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 她们就进去，只是不见主耶稣的身体。 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 正在猜疑之间，忽然有两个人站在旁边，衣服放光。 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 妇女们惊怕，将脸伏地。那两个人就对她们说：“为什么在死人中找活人呢？ And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他不在这里，已经复活了。当记念他还在加利利的时候，怎样告诉你们， He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 说：‘人子必须被交在罪人手里，钉在十字架上，第三日复活。’” Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 她们就想起耶稣的话来， And they remembered his words,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 便从坟墓那里回去，把这一切事告诉十一个使徒和其余的人。 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 那告诉使徒的，就是抹大拉的马利亚和约亚拿，并雅各的母亲马利亚，还有与她们在一处的妇女。 It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 她们这些话，使徒以为是胡言，就不相信。 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 彼得起来，跑到坟墓前，低头往里看，见细麻布独在一处，就回去了，心里希奇所成的事。 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 正当那日，门徒中有两个人往一个村子去；这村子名叫以马忤斯，离耶路撒冷约有二十五里。 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他们彼此谈论所遇见的这一切事。 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 正谈论相问的时候，耶稣亲自就近他们，和他们同行； And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 只是他们的眼睛迷糊了，不认识他。 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 耶稣对他们说：“你们走路彼此谈论的是什么事呢？”他们就站住，脸上带着愁容。 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 二人中有一个名叫革流巴的回答说：“你在耶路撒冷作客，还不知道这几天在那里所出的事吗？” And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 耶稣说：“什么事呢？”他们说：“就是拿撒勒人耶稣的事。他是个先知，在　神和众百姓面前，说话行事都有大能。 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 祭司长和我们的官府竟把他解去，定了死罪，钉在十字架上。 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 但我们素来所盼望要赎以色列民的，就是他。不但如此，而且这事成就，现在已经三天了。 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 再者，我们中间有几个妇女使我们惊奇；她们清早到了坟墓那里， Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 不见他的身体，就回来告诉我们说：‘看见了天使显现，说他活了。’ And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 又有我们的几个人往坟墓那里去，所遇见的，正如妇女们所说的，只是没有看见他。” And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 耶稣对他们说：“无知的人哪！先知所说的一切话，你们的心信得太迟钝了。 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 基督这样受害，又进入他的荣耀，岂不是应当的吗？” Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 于是从摩西和众先知起，凡经上所指着自己的话，都给他们讲解明白了。 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 将近他们所去的村子，耶稣好象还要往前行； And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 他们却强留他说：“时候晚了，日头已经平西了；请你同我们住下吧。”耶稣就进去，要同他们住下。 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 到了坐席的时候，耶稣拿起饼来，祝谢了，掰开，递给他们。 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 他们的眼睛明亮了，这才认出他来；忽然耶稣不见了。 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 他们彼此说：“在路上，他和我们说话，给我们讲解圣经的时候，我们的心岂不是火热的吗？” And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 他们就立时起身，回耶路撒冷去，正遇见十一个使徒和他们的同人，聚集在一处， And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 说：“主果然复活，已经现给西门看了。” Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 两个人就把路上所遇见，和掰饼的时候怎么被他们认出来的事，都述说了一遍。 And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 正说这话的时候，耶稣亲自站在他们当中，说：“愿你们平安。” And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 他们却惊慌害怕，以为所看见的是魂。 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 耶稣说：“你们为什么愁烦？为什么心里起疑念呢？ And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 你们看我的手，我的脚，就知道实在是我了。摸我看看！魂无骨无肉，你们看，我是有的。” Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 说了这话，就把手和脚给他们看。 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 他们正喜得不敢信，并且希奇；耶稣就说：“你们这里有什么吃的没有？” And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 他们便给他一片烧鱼(有古卷在此有“和一块蜜房”)。 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 他接过来，在他们面前吃了。 And he took it, and did eat before them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 耶稣对他们说：“这就是我从前与你们同在之时，所告诉你们的话说：摩西的律法，先知的书和诗篇上所记的，凡指着我的话，都必须应验。” And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 于是耶稣开他们的心窍，使他们能明白圣经； Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 又对他们说：“照经上所写的，基督必受害，第三日从死里复活。 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 并且人要奉他的名传悔、改赦罪的道，从耶路撒冷起直传到万邦。 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 你们就是这些事的见证。 And ye are witnesses of these things.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 我要将我父所应许的降在你们身上，你们要在城里等候，直到你们领受从上头来的能力。” And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 耶稣领他们到伯大尼的对面，就举手给他们祝福。 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: 正祝福的时候，他就离开他们，被带到天上去了。 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">52: 他们就拜他，大大地欢喜，回耶路撒冷去。 And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">53: 常在殿里称颂　神。 And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</p>
