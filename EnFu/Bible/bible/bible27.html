then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 但以理对太监长所派管理但以理、哈拿尼雅、米沙利、亚撒利雅的委办说： Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: “求你试试仆人们十天，给我们素菜吃，白水喝， Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 然后看看我们的面貌和用王膳那少年人的面貌，就照你所看的待仆人吧！” Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 委办便允准他们这件事，试看他们十天。 So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 过了十天，见他们的面貌，比用王膳的一切少年人更加俊美肥胖。 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 于是委办撤去派他们用的膳，饮的酒，给他们素菜吃。 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 这四个少年人，　神在各样文字学问上(“学问”原文作“智慧”)，赐给他们聪明知识；但以理又明白各样的异象和梦兆。 As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 尼布甲尼撒王预定带进少年人来的日期满了，太监长就把他们带到王面前。 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 王与他们谈论，见少年人中，无一人能比但以理、哈拿尼雅、米沙利、亚撒利雅，所以留他们在王面前侍立。 And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 王考问他们一切事，就见他们的智慧聪明，比通国的术士和用法术的，胜过十倍。 And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 到古列王元年，但以理还在。 And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor27_2">但以理书 2</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 尼布甲尼撒在位第二年，他作了梦，心里烦乱，不能睡觉。 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 王吩咐人将术士、用法术的、行邪术的，和迦勒底人召来，要他们将王的梦告诉王。他们就来站在王前。 Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 王对他们说：“我作了一梦，心里烦乱，要知道这是什么梦。” And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 迦勒底人用亚兰的言语对王说：“愿王万岁！请将那梦告诉仆人，仆人就可以讲解。” Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 王回答迦勒底人说：“梦我已经忘了(或作“我已定命”。八节同。)，你们若不将梦和梦的讲解告诉我，就必被凌迟，你们的房屋必成为粪堆； The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 你们若将梦和梦的讲解告诉我，就必从我这里得赠品和赏赐，并大尊荣。现在你们要将梦和梦的讲解告诉我。” But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 他们第二次对王说：“请王将梦告诉仆人，仆人就可以讲解。” They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 王回答说：“我准知道你们是故意迟延，因为你们知道那梦我已经忘了。 The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 你们若不将梦告诉我，只有一法待你们，因为你们预备了谎言乱语向我说，要等候时势改变。现在你们要将梦告诉我，因我知道你们能将梦的讲解告诉我。” But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 迦勒底人在王面前回答说：“世上没有人能将王所问的事说出来，因为没有君王、大臣、掌权的，向术士、或用法术的、或迦勒底人，问过这样的事。 The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 王所问的事甚难，除了不与世人同居的神明；没有人在王面前能说出来。” And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 因此王气忿忿地大发烈怒，吩咐灭绝巴比伦所有的哲士。 For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 于是命令发出，哲士将要见杀，人就寻找但以理和他的同伴，要杀他们。 And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 王的护卫长亚略出来，要杀巴比伦的哲士，但以理就用婉言回答他。 Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 向王的护卫长亚略说：“王的命令为何这样紧急呢？”亚略就将情节告诉但以理。 He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 但以理遂进去求王宽限，就可以将梦的讲解告诉王。 Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 但以理回到他的居所，将这事告诉他的同伴哈拿尼雅、米沙利、亚撒利雅。 Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 要他们祈求天上的　神施怜悯，将这奥秘的事指明，免得但以理和他的同伴，与巴比伦其余的哲士一同灭亡。 That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 这奥秘的事，就在夜间异象中，给但以理显明；但以理便称颂天上的　神。 Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 但以理说：“　神的名是应当称颂的！从亘古直到永远，因为智慧能力都属乎他。 Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 他改变时候、日期、废王、立王，将智慧赐与智慧人，将知识赐与聪明人。 And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 他显明深奥隐秘的事，知道暗中所有的，光明也与他同居。 He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 我列祖的　神啊！我感谢你，赞美你，因你将智慧才能赐给我；允准我们所求的，把王的事给我们指明。” I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 于是，但以理进去见亚略，就是王所派灭绝巴比伦哲士的。对他说：“不要灭绝巴比伦的哲士，求你领我到王面前，我要将梦的讲解告诉王。” Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 亚略就急忙将但以理领到王面前，对王说：“我在被掳的犹大人中遇见一人，他能将梦的讲解告诉王。” Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 王问称为伯提沙撒的但以理说：“你能将我所作的梦和梦的讲解，告诉我吗？” The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 但以理在王面前回答说：“王所问的那奥秘事，哲士、用法术的、术士、观兆的，都不能告诉王； Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 只有一位在天上的　神，能显明奥秘的事，他已将日后必有的事，指示尼布甲尼撒王。你的梦和你在床上脑中的异象是这样： But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 王啊！你在床上想到后来的事，那显明奥秘事的主，把将来必有的事指示你。 As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 至于那奥秘的事显明给我，并非因我的智慧胜过一切活人，乃为使王知道梦的讲解和心里的思念。 But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: “王啊！你梦见一个大像，这像甚高，极其光耀，站在你面前，形状甚是可怕。 Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 这像的头是精金的，胸膛和膀臂是银的，肚腹和腰是铜的， This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 腿是铁的，脚是半铁半泥的。 His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 你观看，见有一块非人手凿出来的石头，打在这像半铁半泥的脚上，把脚砸碎； Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 于是金、银、铜、铁、泥，都一同砸得粉碎，成如夏天禾场上的糠秕，被风吹散，无处可寻。打碎这像的石头，变成一座大山，充满天下。 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: “这就是那梦。我们在王面前要讲解那梦。 This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 王啊！你是诸王之王，天上的　神已将国度、权柄、能力、尊荣都赐给你。 Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 凡世人所住之地的走兽，并天空的飞鸟，他都交付你手，使你掌管这一切。你就是那金头。 And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 在你以后必另兴一国，不及于你；又有第三国，就是铜的，必掌管天下。 And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 第四国，必坚壮如铁，铁能打碎克制百物，又能压碎一切，那国也必打碎压制列国。 And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 你既见像的脚和脚指头，一半是窑匠的泥，一半是铁，那国将来也必分开。你既见铁与泥搀杂，那国也必有铁的力量。 And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 那脚指头，既是半铁半泥，那国也必半强半弱。 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 你既见铁与泥搀杂，那国民也必与各种人搀杂，却不能彼此相合，正如铁与泥不能相合一样。 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 当那列王在位的时候，天上的　神必另立一国，永不败坏；也不归别国的人，却要打碎灭绝那一切国，这国必存到永远。 And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 你既看见非人手凿出来的一块石头，从山而出，打碎金、银、铜、铁、泥，那就是至大的　神把后来必有的事给王指明。这梦准是这样，这讲解也是确实的。” Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 当时，尼布甲尼撒王俯伏在地，向但以理下拜，并且吩咐人给他奉上供物和香品。 Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 王对但以理说：“你既能显明这奥秘的事，你们的　神诚然是万神之神、万王之主，又是显明奥秘事的。” The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 于是王高抬但以理，赏赐他许多上等礼物，派他管理巴比伦全省，又立他为总理，掌管巴比伦的一切哲士。 Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 但以理求王，王就派沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌，管理巴比伦省的事务，只是但以理常在朝中侍立。 Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor27_3">但以理书 3</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 尼布甲尼撒王造了一个金像，高六十肘，宽六肘，立在巴比伦省杜拉平原。 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 尼布甲尼撒王差人将总督、钦差、巡抚、臬司、藩司、谋士、法官，和各省的官员，都召了来，为尼布甲尼撒王所立的像，行开光之礼。 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 于是总督、钦差、巡抚、臬司、藩司、谋士、法官，和各省的官员，都聚集了来，要为尼布甲尼撒王所立的像，行开光之礼，就站在尼布甲尼撒所立的像前。 Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 那时传令的，大声呼叫说：“各方、各国、各族的人哪(“族”原文作“舌”。下同。)！有令传与你们。 Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 你们一听见角、笛、琵琶、琴、瑟、笙，和各样乐器的声音，就当俯伏敬拜尼布甲尼撒王所立的金像。 That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 因此各方、各国、各族的人民，一听见角、笛、琵琶、琴、瑟，和各样乐器的声音，就都俯伏敬拜尼布甲尼撒王所立的金像。 Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 那时，有几个迦勒底人，进前来控告犹大人。 Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他们对尼布甲尼撒王说：“愿王万岁！ They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 王啊！你曾降旨说，凡听见角、笛、琵琶、琴、瑟、笙，和各样乐器声音的，都当俯伏敬拜金像。 Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 现在有几个犹大人，就是王所派管理巴比伦省事务的沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌，王啊！这些人不理你，不事奉你的神，也不敬拜你所立的金像。” There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 当时，尼布甲尼撒冲冲大怒，吩咐人把沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌带过来，他们就把那些人带到王面前。 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 尼布甲尼撒问他们说：“沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌，你们不事奉我的神，也不敬拜我所立的金像，是故意的吗？ Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 你们再听见角、笛、琵琶、琴、瑟、笙，和各样乐器的声音，若俯伏敬拜我所造的像，却还可以；若不敬拜，必立时扔在烈火的窑中，有何神能救你们脱离我手呢？” Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌对王说：“尼布甲尼撒啊！这件事我们不必回答你。 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 即便如此，我们所事奉的　神，能将我们从烈火的窑中救出来。王啊，他也必救我们脱离你的手； If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 即或不然，王啊！你当知道我们决不事奉你的神，也不敬拜你所立的金像。” But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 当时尼布甲尼撒怒气填胸，向沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌变了脸色，吩咐人把窑烧热，比寻常更加七倍。 Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 又吩咐他军中的几个壮士，将沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌捆起来，扔在烈火的窑中。 And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 这三人穿着裤子、内袍、外衣，和别的衣服，被捆起来扔在烈火的窑中。 Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 因为王命紧急，窑又甚热，那抬沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌的人，都被火焰烧死。 Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌这三个人，都被捆着落在烈火的窑中。 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 那时，尼布甲尼撒王惊奇，急忙起来，对谋士说：“我们捆起来扔在火里的不是三个人吗？”他们回答王说：“王啊！是。” Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 王说：“看哪！我见有四个人，并没有捆绑，在火中游行，也没有受伤；那第四个的相貌，好象神子。” He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 于是尼布甲尼撒就近烈火窑门，说：“至高　神的仆人沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌出来，上这里来吧！”沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌，就从火中出来了。 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 那些总督、钦差、巡抚，和王的谋士，一同聚集看这三个人，见火无力伤他们的身体，头发也没有烧焦，衣裳也没有变色，并没有火燎的气味。 And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 尼布甲尼撒说：“沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌的　神，是应当称颂的！他差遣使者救护倚靠他的仆人，他们不遵王命，舍去己身，在他们　神以外不肯事奉敬拜别神。 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 现在我降旨，无论何方、何国、何族的人，谤讟沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌之　神的，必被凌迟。他的房屋必成粪堆，因为没有别神能这样施行拯救。” Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 那时王在巴比伦省，高升了沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌。 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor27_4">但以理书 4</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 尼布甲尼撒王，晓谕住在全地各方、各国、各族的人说：“愿你们大享平安！ Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 我乐意将至高的　神向我所行的神迹奇事，宣扬出来。 I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 他的神迹何其大！他的奇事何其盛！他的国是永远的！他的权柄存到万代。 How great are his signs!

Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 于是称为伯提沙撒的但以理，惊讶片时，心意惊惶。王说：“伯提沙撒啊！不要因梦和梦的讲解惊惶。”伯提沙撒回答说：“我主啊！愿这梦归与恨恶你的人；讲解归与你的敌人。 Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 你所见的树渐长，而且坚固，高得顶天，从地极都能看见； The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 叶子华美，果子甚多，可作众生的食物；田野的走兽，住在其下；天空的飞鸟，宿在枝上。 Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: “王啊！这渐长又坚固的树，就是你。你的威势渐长及天，你的权柄管到地极。 It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 王既看见一位守望的圣者从天而降，说：‘将这树砍伐毁坏，树蘖却要留在地内。用铁圈和铜圈箍住；在田野的青草中，让天露滴湿，使他与地上的兽一同吃草，直到经过七期。’ And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: “王啊！讲解就是这样：临到我主我王的事，是出于至高者的命。 This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 你必被赶出离开世人，与野地的兽同居，吃草如牛，被天露滴湿，且要经过七期。等你知道至高者在人的国中掌权，要将国赐与谁，就赐与谁。 That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 守望者既吩咐存留树蘖，等你知道诸天掌权，以后你的国必定归你。 And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 王啊！求你悦纳我的谏言，以施行公义断绝罪过，以怜悯穷人除掉罪孽，或者你的平安可以延长。” Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 这事都临到尼布甲尼撒王。 All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 过了十二个月，他游行在巴比伦王宫里(原文作“上”)。 At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 他说：“这大巴比伦不是我用大能大力建为京都，要显我威严的荣耀吗？” The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 这话在王口中尚未说完，有声音从天降下，说：“尼布甲尼撒王啊！有话对你说：“你的国位离开你了。 While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 你必被赶出离开世人，与野地的兽同居，吃草如牛，且要经过七期。等你知道至高者在人的国中掌权，要将国赐与谁，就赐与谁。” And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 当时这话就应验在尼布甲尼撒的身上，他被赶出离开世人，吃草如牛，身被天露滴湿，头发长长，好象鹰毛；指甲长长，如同鸟爪。 The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 日子满足，我尼布甲尼撒举目望天，我的聪明复归于我，我便称颂至高者，赞美尊敬活到永远的　神。他的权柄是永有的，他的国存到万代。 And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 世上所有的居民，都算为虚无。在天上的万军和世上的居民中，他都凭自己的意旨行事。无人能拦住他手，或问他说：你作什么呢？ And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 那时我的聪明复归于我，为我国的荣耀威严和光耀，也都复归于我；并且我的谋士和大臣，也来朝见我。我又得坚立在国位上，至大的权柄加增于我。 At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 现在我尼布甲尼撒赞美、尊崇、恭敬天上的王，因为他所作的全都诚实，他所行的也都公平。那行动骄傲的，他能降为卑。 Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor27_5">但以理书 5</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 伯沙撒欢饮之间，吩咐人将他父(“父”或作“祖”。下同。)尼布甲尼撒从耶路撒冷殿中所掠的金银器皿拿来，王与大臣、皇后、妃嫔，好用这器皿饮酒。 Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 于是他们把耶路撒冷　神殿库房中所掠的金器皿拿来，王和大臣、皇后、妃嫔，就用这器皿饮酒。 Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 就变了脸色，心意惊惶，腰骨好象脱节，双膝彼此相碰。 Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 于是王的一切哲士都进来，却不能读那文字，也不能把讲解告诉王。 Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 伯沙撒王就甚惊惶，脸色改变，他的大臣也都惊奇。 Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 太后(或作“皇后”。下同。)因王和他大臣所说的话，就进入宴宫，说：“愿王万岁！你心意不要惊惶，脸面不要变色。 Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 在你国中有一人，他里头有圣神的灵，你父在世的日子，这人心中光明，又有聪明智慧，好象神的智慧。你父尼布甲尼撒王，就是王的父，立他为术士、用法术的，和迦勒底人并观兆的领袖。 There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 在他里头有美好的灵性，又有知识聪明，能圆梦、释谜语、解疑惑。这人名叫但以理，尼布甲尼撒王又称他为伯提沙撒；现在可以召他来，他必解明这意思。” Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 但以理就被领到王前。王问但以理说：“你是被掳之犹大人中的但以理吗？就是我父王从犹大掳来的吗？ Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 我听说你里头有神的灵，心中光明，又有聪明和美好的智慧。 I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 现在哲士和用法术的，都领到我面前，为叫他们读这文字，把讲解告诉我，无奈他们都不能把讲解说出来。 And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 我听说你善于讲解，能解疑惑；现在你若能读这文字，把讲解告诉我，就必身穿紫袍，项戴金链，在我国中位列第三。” And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 但以理在王面前回答说：“你的赠品可以归你自己，你的赏赐可以归给别人；我却要为王读这文字，把讲解告诉王。 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 王啊！至高的　神曾将国位、大权、荣耀、威严赐与你父尼布甲尼撒。 O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 因　神所赐他的大权，各方、各国、各族的人，都在他面前战兢恐惧。他可以随意生杀，随意升降。 And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 但他心高气傲，灵也刚愎，甚至行事狂傲，就被革去王位，夺去荣耀。 But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 他被赶出离开世人，他的心变如兽心，与野驴同居。吃草如牛，身被天露滴湿；等他知道至高的　神在人的国中掌权，凭自己的意旨立人治国。 And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 伯沙撒啊！你是他的儿子(或作“孙子”)，你虽知道这一切，你心仍不自卑， And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 竟向天上的主自高。使人将他殿中的器皿拿到你面前，你和大臣、皇后、妃嫔用这器皿饮酒。你又赞美那不能看，不能听，无知无识，金银铜铁木石所造的神，却没有将荣耀归与那手中有你气息，管理你一切行动的　神。 But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 因此，从　神那里显出指头来，写这文字。 Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: “所写的文字是：弥尼，弥尼，提客勒，乌法珥新。 And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 讲解是这样：弥尼，就是　神已经数算你国的年日到此完毕。 This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 提客勒，就是你被称在天平里，显出你的亏欠。 TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 毗勒斯(与“乌法珥新”同义)，就是你的国分裂，归与玛代人和波斯人。” PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 伯沙撒下令，人就把紫袍给但以理穿上，把金链给他戴在颈项上，又传令使他在国中位列第三。 Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 当夜，迦勒底王伯沙撒被杀。 In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 玛代人大利乌，年六十二岁，取了迦勒底国。 And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor27_6">但以理书 6</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 大利乌随心所愿，立一百二十个总督，治理通国。 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 又在他们以上立总长三人(但以理在其中)，使总督在他们三人面前回复事务，免得王受亏损。 And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 因这但以理有美好的灵性，所以显然超乎其余的总长和总督，王又想立他治理通国。 Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 那时总长和总督，寻找但以理误国的把柄，为要参他；只是找不着他的错误过失，因他忠心办事，毫无错误过失。 Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 那些人便说，我们要找参这但以理的把柄，除非在他　神的律法中就寻不着。 Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 于是总长和总督，纷纷聚集来见王，说：“愿大利乌王万岁！ Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 国中的总长、钦差、总督、谋士和巡抚，彼此商议，要立一条坚定的禁令(或作“求王下旨要立一条云云”)，三十日内，不拘何人，若在王以外，或向神或向人求什么，就必扔在狮子坑中。 All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 王啊！现在求你立这禁令，加盖玉玺，使禁令决不更改；照玛代和波斯人的例，是不可更改的。” Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 于是大利乌王立这禁令，加盖玉玺。 Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 但以理知道这禁令盖了玉玺，就到自己家里(他楼上的窗户，开向耶路撒冷)，一日三次，双膝跪在他　神面前，祷告感谢，与素常一样。 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 那些人就纷纷聚集，见但以理在他　神面前祈祷恳求。 Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他们便进到王前，提王的禁令，说：“王啊！三十日内不拘何人，若在王以外，或向神或向人求什么，必被扔在狮子坑中。王不是在这禁令上盖了玉玺吗？”王回答说：“实有这事，照玛代和波斯人的例，是不可更改的。” Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他们对王说：“王啊！那被掳之犹大人中的但以理不理你，也不遵你盖了玉玺的禁令，他竟一日三次祈祷。” Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 王听见这话，就甚愁烦，一心要救但以理，筹划解救他，直到日落的时候。 Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 那些人就纷纷聚集来见王，说：“王啊！当知道玛代人和波斯人有例，凡王所立的禁令和律例，都不可更改。” Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 王下令，人就把但以理带来，扔在狮子坑中。王对但以理说：“你所常事奉的　神，他必救你。” Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 有人搬石头放在坑口，王用自己的玺和大臣的印，封闭那坑，使惩办但以理的事，毫无更改。 And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 王回宫，终夜禁食；无人拿乐器到他面前，并且睡不着觉。 Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 次日黎明，王就起来，急忙往狮子坑那里去。 Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 临近坑边，哀声呼叫但以理，对但以理说：“永生　神的仆人但以理啊！你所常事奉的　神能救你脱离狮子吗？” And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 但以理对王说：“愿王万岁！ Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 我的　神差遣使者，封住狮子的口，叫狮子不伤我；因我在　神面前无辜，我在王面前也没有行过亏损的事。” My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 王就甚喜乐，吩咐人将但以理从坑里系上来。于是但以理从坑里被系上来，身上毫无伤损，因为信靠他的　神。 Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 王下令，人就把那些控告但以理的人，连他们的妻子儿女都带来，扔在狮子坑中。他们还没有到坑底，狮子就抓住他们(“抓住”原文作“胜了”)，咬碎他们的骨头。 And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 那时大利乌王传旨，晓谕住在全地各方、各国、各族的人，说：“愿你们大享平安！ Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 现在我降旨晓谕我所统辖的全国人民，要在但以理的　神面前，战兢恐惧，因为他是永远长存的活　神，他的国永不败坏，他的权柄永存无极。 I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 他护庇人，搭救人，在天上地下施行神迹奇事，救了但以理脱离狮子的口。” He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 如此，这但以理当大利乌王在位的时候和波斯王古列在位的时候，大享亨通。 So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor27_7">但以理书 7</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 巴比伦王伯沙撒元年，但以理在床上作梦，见了脑中的异象，就记录这梦，述说其中的大意。 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 但以理说：我夜里见异象，看见天的四风陡起，刮在大海之上。 Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 有四个大兽从海中上来，形状各有不同： And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 头一个象狮子，有鹰的翅膀；我正观看的时候，兽的翅膀被拔去，兽从地上得立起来，用两脚站立，象人一样，又得了人心。 The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 又有一兽如熊，就是第二兽，旁跨而坐，口齿内衔着三根肋骨。有吩咐这兽的说：“起来吞吃多肉。” And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 此后我观看，又有一兽如豹，背上有鸟的四个翅膀；这兽有四个头，又得了权柄。 After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 其后我在夜间的异象中观看，见第四兽甚是可怕，极其强壮，大有力量，有大铁牙，吞吃嚼碎，所剩下的用脚践踏。这兽与前三兽大不相同，头有十角。 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 我正观看这些角，见其中又长起一个小角；先前的角中，有三角在这角前，连根被它拔出来。这角有眼，象人的眼，有口说夸大的话。 I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 我观看，见有宝座设立，上头坐着亘古常在者。他的衣服洁白如雪，头发如纯净的羊毛。宝座乃火焰，其轮乃烈火。 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 从他面前有火象河发出。事奉他的有千千，在他面前侍立的有万万。他坐着要行审判，案卷都展开了。 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 那时我观看，见那兽因小角说夸大话的声音被杀，身体损坏，扔在火中焚烧。 I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 其余的兽，权柄都被夺去；生命却仍存留，直到所定的时候和日期。 As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我在夜间的异象中观看，见有一位象人子的，驾着天云而来，被领到亘古常在者面前， I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 得了权柄、荣耀、国度，使各方、各国、各族的人都事奉他。他的权柄是永远的，不能废去；他的国必不败坏。 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 至于我但以理，我的灵在我里面愁烦，我脑中的异象使我惊惶。 I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 我就近一位侍立者，问他这一切的真情。他就告诉我，将那事的讲解给我说明； I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 这四个大兽就是四王将要在世上兴起。 These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 然而，至高者的圣民，必要得国享受，直到永永远远。 But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 那时我愿知道第四兽的真情，它为何与那三兽的真情大不相同，甚是可怕，有铁牙铜爪，吞吃嚼碎，所剩下的用脚践踏。 Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 头有十角和那另长的一角，在这角前有三角被它打落。这角有眼，有说夸大话的口，形状强横，过于它的同类。 And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 我观看，见这角与圣民争战，胜了他们。 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 直到亘古常在者来给至高者的圣民伸冤，圣民得国的时候就到了。 Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 那侍立者这样说：“第四兽就是世上必有的第四国，与一切国大不相同，必吞吃全地，并且践踏嚼碎。 Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 至于那十角，就是从这国中必兴起的十王，后来又兴起一王，与先前的不同，他必制伏三王。 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 他必向至高者说夸大的话，必折磨至高者的圣民，必想改变节期和律法。圣民必交付他手一载、二载、半载。 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 然而审判者必坐着行审判，他的权柄必被夺去、毁坏、灭绝，一直到底。 But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 国度、权柄，和天下诸国的大权，必赐给至高者的圣民。他的国是永远的，一切掌权的都必事奉他，顺从他。” And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 那事至此完毕。至于我但以理，心中甚是惊惶，脸色也改变了，却将那事存记在心。 Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor27_8">但以理书 8</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 伯沙撒王在位第三年，有异象现与我但以理，是在先前所见的异象之后。 In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 我见了异象的时候，我以为在以拦省书珊城中(“城”或作“宫”)。我见异象又如在乌莱河边。 And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 我举目观看，见有双角的公绵羊站在河边，两角都高。这角高过那角，更高的是后长的。 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 我见那公绵羊往西、往北、往南抵触，兽在它面前都站立不住，也没有能救护脱离它手的。但它任意而行，自高自大。 I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 我正思想的时候，见有一只公山羊从西而来，遍行全地，脚不沾尘。这山羊两眼当中，有一非常的角。 And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 它往我所看见站在河边有双角的公绵羊那里去，大发忿怒，向它直闯。 And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 我见公山羊就近公绵羊，向它发烈怒，抵触它，折断它的两角。绵羊在它面前站立不住；它将绵羊触倒在地，用脚践踏，没有能救绵羊脱离它手的。 And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 这山羊极其自高自大，正强盛的时候，那大角折断了，又在角根上向天的四方(“方”原文作“风”)长出四个非常的角来。 Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 四角之中，有一角长出一个小角，向南、向东、向荣美之地，渐渐成为强大。 And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 它渐渐强大，高及天象，将些天象和星宿抛落在地，用脚践踏。 And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 并且它自高自大，以为高及天象之君。除掉常献给君的燔祭，毁坏君的圣所。 Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 因罪过的缘故，有军旅和常献的燔祭交付它。它将真理抛在地上，任意而行，无不顺利。 And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我听见有一位圣者说话，又有一位圣者问那说话的圣者说：“这除掉常献的燔祭和施行毁坏的罪过，将圣所与军旅践踏的异象(“军旅”或作“以色列的军”)，要到几时才应验呢？” Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他对我说：“到二千三百日，圣所就必洁净。” And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 我但以理见了这异象，愿意明白其中的意思。忽有一位形状象人的，站在我面前。 And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 我又听见乌莱河两岸中有人声呼叫说：“加百列啊！要使此人明白这异象。” And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 他便来到我所站的地方。他一来，我就惊慌俯伏在地，他对我说：“人子啊！你要明白，因为这是关乎末后的异象。” So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 他与我说话的时候，我面伏在地沉睡；他就摸我，扶我站起来， Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 说：“我要指示你恼怒临完必有的事，因为这是关乎末后的定期。 And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 你所看见双角的公绵羊，就是玛代和波斯王。 The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 那公山羊就是希腊王(“希腊”原文作“雅完”。下同。)；两眼当中的大角，就是头一王。 And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 至于那折断了的角，在其根上又长出四角，这四角就是四国，必从这国里兴起来，只是权势都不及他。 Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 这四国末时，犯法的人罪恶满盈，必有一王兴起，面貌凶恶，能用双关的诈语。 And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 他的权柄必大，却不是因自己的能力，他必行非常的毁灭。事情顺利，任意而行；又必毁灭有能力的和圣民。 And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 他用权术成就手中的诡计，心里自高自大，在人坦然无备的时候，毁灭多人。又要站起来攻击万君之君，至终却非因人手而灭亡。 And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 所说二千三百日的异象是真的。但你要将这异象封住，因为关乎后来许多的日子。” And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 于是我但以理昏迷不醒，病了数日，然后起来办理王的事务。我因这异象惊奇，却无人能明白其中的意思。 And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor27_9">但以理书 9</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 就是他在位第一年，我但以理从书上得知耶和华的话临到先知耶利米，论耶路撒冷荒凉的年数，七十年为满。 In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 我们犯罪作孽，行恶叛逆，偏离你的诫命典章， We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 没有听从你仆人众先知奉你名向我们君王、首领、列祖，和国中一切百姓所说的话。 Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 主啊！你是公义的，我们是脸上蒙羞的；因我们犹大人和耶路撒冷的居民，并以色列众人，或在近处或在远处，被你赶到各国的人，都得罪了你，正如今日一样。 O LORD, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他使大灾祸临到我们，成就了警戒我们和审判我们官长的话；原来在普天之下，未曾行过象在耶路撒冷所行的。 And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 这一切灾祸临到我们身上，是照摩西律法上所写的。我们却没有求耶和华我们　神的恩典，使我们回头离开罪孽，明白你的真理。 As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他就说：“但以理啊！不要惧怕，因为从你第一日专心求明白将来的事，又在你　神面前刻苦己心，你的言语已蒙应允；我是因你的言语而来。 Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 但波斯国的魔君，拦阻我二十一日，忽然有大君(就是“天使长”。二十一节同。)中的一位米迦勒来帮助我，我就停留在波斯诸王那里。 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 现在我来要使你明白本国之民日后必遭遇的事，因为这异象关乎后来许多的日子。” Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 他向我这样说，我就脸面朝地，哑口无声。 And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 不料，有一位象人的，摸我的嘴唇，我便开口向那站在我面前的说：“我主啊！因见这异象我大大愁苦，毫无气力。 And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 我主的仆人怎能与我主说话呢？我一见异象就浑身无力，毫无气息。” For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 有一位形状象人的，又摸我使我有力量。 Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他说：“大蒙眷爱的人哪！不要惧怕，愿你平安；你总要坚强。”他一向我说话，我便觉得有力量，说：“我主请说，因你使我有力量。” And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 他就说：“你知道我为何来见你吗？现在我要回去与波斯的魔君争战，我去后希腊(原文作“雅完”)的魔君必来。 Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 但我要将那录在真确书上的事告诉你。除了你们的大君米迦勒之外，没有帮助我抵挡这两魔君的。” But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor27_11">但以理书 11</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 又说：“当玛代王大利乌元年，我曾起来扶助米迦勒，使他坚强。 Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 现在我将真事指示你：“波斯还有三王兴起，第四王必富足远胜诸王。他因富足成为强盛，就必激动大众攻击希腊国。 And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 必有一个勇敢的王兴起，执掌大权，随意而行。 And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他兴起的时候，他的国必破裂，向天的四方(“方”原文作“风”)分开，却不归他的后裔，治国的权势也都不及他；因为他的国必被拔出，归与他后裔之外的人。 And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: “南方的王必强盛，他将帅中必有一个比他更强盛，执掌权柄，他的权柄甚大。 And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 过些年后，他们必互相连合。南方王的女儿必就了北方王来立约；但这女子帮助之力存立不住，王和他所倚靠之力也不能存立。这女子和引导她来的，并生她的，以及当时扶助她的，都必交与死地。 And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 但这女子的本家(“本家”原文作“根”)必另生一子(“子”原文作“枝”)继续王位。他必率领军队进入北方王的保障，攻击他们，而且得胜。 But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 并将他们的神像和铸成的偶像，与金银的宝器掠到埃及去。数年之内，他不去攻击北方的王。 And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 北方的王(原文作“他”)必入南方王的国，却要仍回本地。 So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: “北方王(原文作“他”)的二子必动干戈，招聚许多军兵。这军兵前去，如洪水泛滥，又必再去争战，直到南方王的保障。 But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 南方王必发烈怒，出来与北方王争战，摆列大军；北方王的军兵必交付他手。 And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他的众军高傲，他的心也必自高；他虽使数万人仆倒，却不得常胜。 And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: “北方王必回来摆列大军，比先前的更多。满了所定的年数，他必率领大军，带极多的军装来。 For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 那时，必有许多人起来攻击南方王，并且你本国的强暴人必兴起。要应验那异象，他们却要败亡。 And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 北方王必来筑垒攻取坚固城；南方的军兵必站立不住，就是选择的精兵(“精兵”原文作“民”)也无力站住。 So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 来攻击他的，必任意而行；无人在北方王(原文作“他”)面前站立得住。他必站在那荣美之地，用手施行毁灭。 But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: “他必定意用全国之力而来，立公正的约，照约而行，将自己的女儿给南方王为妻，想要败坏他(或作“埃及”)。这计却不得成就，与自己毫无益处。 He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 其后他必转回夺取了许多海岛。但有一大帅，除掉他令人受的羞辱，并且使这羞辱归他本身。 After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他就必转向本地的保障，却要绊跌仆倒，归于无有。 Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: “那时，必有一人兴起接续他为王，使横征暴敛的人，通行国中的荣美地。这王不多日就必灭亡，却不因忿怒，也不因争战。 Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: “必有一个卑鄙的人兴起接续为王，人未曾将国的尊荣给他；他却趁人坦然无备的时候，用谄媚的话得国。 And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 必有无数的军兵势如洪水，在他面前冲没败坏；同盟的君也必如此。 And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 与那君结盟之后，他必行诡诈；因为他必上来以微小的军(原文作“民”)成为强盛。 And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 趁人坦然无备的时候，他必来到国中极肥美之地，行他列祖和他列祖之祖所未曾行的，将掳物、掠物和财宝，散给众人；又要设计攻打保障，然而这都是暂时的。 He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: “他必奋勇向前，率领大军攻击南方王；南方王也必以极大极强的军兵与他争战，却站立不住；因为有人设计谋害南方王。 And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 吃王膳的，必败坏他；他的军队，必被冲没，而且被杀的甚多。 Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 至于这二王，他们心怀恶计，同席说谎，计谋却不成就；因为到了定期，事就了结。 And both these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 北方王(原文作“他”)必带许多财宝回往本国，他的心反对圣约，任意而行，回到本地。 Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: “到了定期，他必返回，来到南方。后一次却不如前一次， At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 因为基提战船，必来攻击他，他就丧胆而回。又要恼恨圣约，任意而行；他必回来联络背弃圣约的人。 For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 他必兴兵，这兵必亵渎圣地，就是保障。除掉常献的燔祭，设立那行毁坏可憎的。 And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 作恶违背圣约的人，他必用巧言勾引；惟独认识　神的子民，必刚强行事。 And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 民间的智慧人，必训诲多人。然而，他们多日必倒在刀下，或被火烧，或被掳掠抢夺。 And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 他们仆倒的时候，稍得扶助，却有许多人用谄媚的话亲近他们。 Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 智慧人中有些仆倒的，为要熬炼其余的人，使他们清净洁白，直到末了；因为到了定期，事就了结。 And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: “王必任意而行，自高自大，超过所有的神。又用奇异的话攻击万神之神。他必行事亨通，直到主的忿怒完毕，因为所定的事，必然成就。 And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 他必不顾他列祖的神，也不顾妇女所羡慕的神；无论何神他都不顾，因为他必自大，高过一切。 Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 他倒要敬拜保障的神，用金银宝石，和可爱之物，敬奉他列祖所不认识的神。 But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 他必靠外邦神的帮助，攻破最坚固的保障。凡承认他的，他必将荣耀加给他们，使他们管辖许多人，又为贿赂分地与他们。 Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: “到末了，南方王要与他交战。北方王必用战车、马兵和许多战船，势如暴风来攻击他，也必进入列国如洪水泛滥。 And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 又必进入那荣美之地，有许多国就被倾覆。但以东人、摩押人、和一大半亚扪人，必脱离他的手。 He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 他必伸手攻击列国；埃及地也不得脱离。 He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 他必把持埃及的金银财宝和各样的宝物。利比亚人和古实人都必跟从他。 But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 但从东方和北方必有消息扰乱他，他就大发烈怒出去，要将多人杀灭净尽。 But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 他必在海和荣美的圣山中间，设立他如宫殿的帐幕；然而到了他的结局，必无人能帮助他。” And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor27_12">但以理书 12</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: “那时保佑你本国之民的天使长(原文作“大君”)米迦勒，必站起来。并且有大艰难，从有国以来直到此时，没有这样的。你本国的民中，凡名录在册上的，必得拯救。 And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 睡在尘埃中的，必有多人复醒。其中有得永生的，有受羞辱永远被憎恶的。 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 智慧人必发光，如同天上的光；那使多人归义的，必发光如星，直到永永远远。 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 我但以理观看，见另有两个人站立：一个在河这边，一个在河那边。 Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 有一个问那站在河水以上，穿细麻衣的说：“这奇异的事，到几时才应验呢？” And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 我听见那站在河水以上，穿细麻衣的，向天举起左右手，指着活到永远的主起誓，说：“要到一载、二载、半载，打破圣民权力的时候，这一切事就都应验了。” And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 我听见这话，却不明白，就说：“我主啊！这些事的结局是怎样呢？” And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;
