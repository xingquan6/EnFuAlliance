And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 各有四个脸面，四个翅膀。 And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 他们的腿是直的，脚掌好象牛犊之蹄，都灿烂如光明的铜。 And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 在四面的翅膀以下有人的手。这四个活物的脸和翅膀，乃是这样： And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 翅膀彼此相接，行走并不转身，俱各直往前行。 Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 至于脸的形象：前面各有人的脸，右面各有狮子的脸，左面各有牛的脸，后面各有鹰的脸。 As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 各展开上边的两个翅膀相接，各以下边的两个翅膀遮体。 Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他们俱各直往前行。灵往哪里去，他们就往哪里去，行走并不转身。 And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 至于四活物的形象，就如烧着火炭的形状，又如火把的形状。火在四活物中间上去下来，这火有光辉，从火中发出闪电。 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 这活物往来奔走，好象电光一闪。 And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 我正观看活物的时候，见活物的脸旁，各有一轮在地上。 Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 轮的形状和颜色(原文作“作法”)好象水苍玉。四轮都是一个样式，形状和作法，好象轮中套轮。 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 轮行走的时候，向四方都能直行，并不掉转。 When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 至于轮辋，高而可畏；四个轮辋周围满有眼睛。 As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 活物行走，轮也在旁边行走；活物从地上升，轮也都上升。 And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 灵往哪里去，活物就往哪里去；活物上升，轮也在活物旁边上升；因为活物的灵在轮中。 Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 那些行走，这些也行走；那些站住，这些也站住；那些从地上升，轮也在旁边上升；因为活物的灵在轮中。 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 活物的头以上，有穹苍的形象，看着象可畏的水晶，铺张在活物的头以上。 And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 穹苍以下，活物的翅膀直张，彼此相对；每活物有两个翅膀遮体。 And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 活物行走的时候，我听见翅膀的响声；象大水的声音，象全能者的声音，也象军队哄嚷的声音。活物站住的时候，便将翅膀垂下。 And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 在他们头以上的穹苍之上有声音。他们站住的时候，便将翅膀垂下。 And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 在他们头以上的穹苍之上，有宝座的形象，仿佛蓝宝石；在宝座形象以上，有仿佛人的形状。 And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 我见从他腰以上，有仿佛光耀的精金，周围都有火的形状；又见从他腰以下，有仿佛火的形状，周围也有光辉。 And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 下雨的日子，云中虹的形状怎样，周围光辉的形状也是怎样。这就是耶和华荣耀的形象。我一看见就俯伏在地，又听见一位说话的声音。 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor26_2">以西结书 2</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 他对我说：“人子啊！你站起来，我要和你说话。” And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 他对我说话的时候，灵就进入我里面，使我站起来，我便听见那位对我说话的声音。 And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 他对我说：“人子啊！我差你往悖逆的国民以色列人那里去。他们是悖逆我的，他们和他们的列祖违背我，直到今日。 And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 这众子，面无羞耻，心里刚硬；我差你往他们那里去，你要对他们说：主耶和华如此说。 For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他们或听，或不听，(他们是悖逆之家)必知道在他们中间有了先知。 And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: “人子啊！虽有荆棘和蒺藜在你那里，你又住在蝎子中间，总不要怕他们，也不要怕他们的话；他们虽是悖逆之家，还不要怕他们的话，也不要因他们的脸色惊惶。 And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 他们或听，或不听，你只管将我的话告诉他们；他们是极其悖逆的。 And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: “人子啊！要听我对你所说的话，不要悖逆象那悖逆之家，你要开口吃我所赐给你的。” But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 我观看，见有一只手向我伸出来，手中有一书卷。 And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 他将书卷在我面前展开，内外都写着字，其上所写的有哀号、叹息、悲痛的话。 And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor26_3">以西结书 3</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 他对我说：“人子啊！要吃你所得的，要吃这书卷，好去对以色列家讲说。” Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 于是我开口，他就使我吃这书卷。 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 又对我说：“人子啊！要吃我所赐给你的这书卷，充满你的肚腹。”我就吃了，口中觉得其甜如蜜。 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他对我说：“人子啊！你往以色列家那里去，将我的话对他们讲说。 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 你奉差遣不是往那说话深奥，言语难懂的民那里去，乃是往以色列家去。 For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 不是往那说话深奥，言语难懂的多国去，他们的话语是你不懂得的；我若差你往他们那里去，他们必听从你。 Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 以色列家却不肯听从你，因为他们不肯听从我；原来以色列全家是额坚心硬的人。 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 看哪！我使你的脸硬过他们的脸；使你的额硬过他们的额。 Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 我使你的额象金钢钻，比火石更硬。他们虽是悖逆之家，你不要怕他们，也不要因他们的脸色惊惶。” As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 他又对我说：“人子啊！我对你所说的一切话，要心里领会，耳中听闻。 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 你往你本国被掳的子民那里去，他们或听，或不听，你要对他们讲说。告诉他们，这是主耶和华说的。” And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 那时灵将我举起，我就听见在我身后有震动轰轰的声音，说：“从耶和华的所在显出来的荣耀是该称颂的！” Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我又听见那活物翅膀相碰，与活物旁边轮子旋转震动轰轰的响声。 I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 于是灵将我举起，带我而去。我心中甚苦，灵性忿激，并且耶和华的灵(原文作“手”)在我身上大有能力。 So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 我就来到提勒亚毕，住在迦巴鲁河边被掳的人那里，到他们所住的地方，在他们中间忧忧闷闷地坐了七日。 Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 过了七日，耶和华的话临到我说： And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: “人子啊！我立你作以色列家守望的人，所以你要听我口中的话，替我警戒他们。 Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 我何时指着恶人说：他必要死，你若不警戒他，也不劝戒他，使他离开恶行，拯救他的性命，这恶人必死在罪孽之中，我却要向你讨他丧命的罪(原文作“血”)。 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 倘若你警戒恶人，他仍不转离罪恶，也不离开恶行，他必死在罪孽之中，你却救自己脱离了罪。 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: “再者，义人何时离义而犯罪，我将绊脚石放在他面前，他就必死；因你没有警戒他，他必死在罪中，他素来所行的义不被记念，我却要向你讨他丧命的罪(原文作“血”)。 Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 倘若你警戒义人，使他不犯罪，他就不犯罪；他因受警戒就必存活，你也救自己脱离了罪。” Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 耶和华的灵(原文作“手”)在那里降在我身上。他对我说：“你起来往平原去，我要在那里和你说话。” And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 于是我起来往平原去。不料，耶和华的荣耀，正如我在迦巴鲁河边所见的一样，停在那里，我就俯伏于地。 Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 灵就进入我里面，使我站起来。耶和华对我说：“你进房屋去，将门关上。 Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 人子啊！人必用绳索捆绑你，你就不能出去在他们中间来往。 But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 我必使你的舌头贴住上膛，以致你哑口，不能作责备他们的人；他们原是悖逆之家。 And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 但我对你说话的时候，必使你开口，你就要对他们说‘主耶和华如此说’，听的可以听，不听的任他不听。因为他们是悖逆之家。” But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor26_4">以西结书 4</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: “人子啊！你要拿一块砖，摆在你面前，将一座耶路撒冷城画在其上。 Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, even Jerusalem:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 又围困这城，造台筑垒，安营攻击，在四围安设撞锤攻城。 And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 又要拿个铁鏊，放在你和城的中间，作为铁墙。你要对面攻击这城，使城被困；这样，好作以色列家的预兆。 Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: “你要向左侧卧，承当以色列家的罪孽；要按你向左侧卧的日数，担当他们的罪孽； Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 因为我已将他们作孽的年数，定为你向左侧卧的日数，就是三百九十日，你要这样担当以色列家的罪孽。 For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 再者，你满了这些日子，还要向右侧卧，担当犹大家的罪孽。我给你定规侧卧四十日，一日顶一年。 And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: “你要露出膀臂，面向被困的耶路撒冷，说预言攻击这城。 Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 我用绳索捆绑你，使你不能辗转，直等你满了困城的日子。 And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: “你要取小麦、大麦、豆子、红豆、小米、粗麦，装在一个器皿中，用以为自己作饼。要按你侧卧的三百九十日吃这饼。 Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 你所吃的要按分两吃，每日二十舍客勒；按时而吃。 And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 你喝水也要按制子，每日喝一欣六分之一，按时而喝。 Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 你吃这饼，象吃大麦饼一样，要用人粪在众人眼前烧烤。” And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 耶和华说：“以色列人在我所赶他们到的各国中，也必这样吃不洁净的食物。” And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 我说：“哎！主耶和华啊！我素来未曾被玷污，从幼年到如今没有吃过自死的，或被野兽撕裂的，那可憎的肉也未曾入我的口。” Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 于是他对我说：“看哪！我给你牛粪代替人粪，你要将你的饼烤在其上。” Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 他又对我说：“人子啊！我必在耶路撒冷折断他们的杖，就是断绝他们的粮。他们吃饼要按分两，忧虑而吃；喝水也要按制子，惊惶而喝； Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 使他们缺粮、缺水，彼此惊惶，因自己的罪孽消灭。” That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor26_5">以西结书 5</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 围困城的日子满了，你要将三分之一在城中用火焚烧；将三分之一在城的四围用刀砍碎；将三分之一任风吹散；我也要拔刀追赶。 Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, and smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 你要从其中取几根，包在衣襟里。 Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 所以主耶和华如此说，因为你们纷争过于四围的列国，也不遵行我的律例，不谨守我的典章，并以遵从四围列国的恶规尚不满意； Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 所以主耶和华如此说，看哪！我与你反对，必在列国的眼前，在你中间，施行审判。 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 主耶和华说：“我指着我的永生起誓，因你用一切可憎的物，可厌的事，玷污了我的圣所；故此，我定要使你人数减少，我眼必不顾惜你，也不可怜你。 Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 你的民三分之一，必遭瘟疫而死，在你中间必因饥荒消灭；三分之一必在你四围倒在刀下；我必将三分之一分散四方(“方”原文作“风”)，并要拔刀追赶他们。 A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: “我要这样成就怒中所定的，我向他们发的忿怒止息了，自己就得着安慰；我在他们身上成就怒中所定的，那时他们就知道我耶和华所说的，是出于热心。 Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

I the LORD have spoken it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 那时，我要将灭人使人饥荒的恶箭，就是射去灭人的，射在你们身上，并要加增你们的饥荒，断绝你们所倚靠的粮食； When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 又要使饥荒和恶兽到你那里，叫你丧子；瘟疫和流血的事，也必盛行在你那里，我也要使刀剑临到你。这是我耶和华说的。” So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee.

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 我也要将以色列人的尸首放在他们的偶像面前；将你们的骸骨，抛散在你们祭坛的四围。 And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 在你们一切的住处，城邑要变为荒场，邱坛必然凄凉，使你们的祭坛荒废，将你们的偶像打碎。你们的日象被砍倒，你们的工作被毁灭。 In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 那脱离刀剑的人，必在所掳到的各国中记念我；为他们心中何等伤破，是因他们起淫心，远离我，眼对偶像行邪淫。他们因行一切可憎的恶事，必厌恶自己。 And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 又对我说：“人子啊！以色列家所行的，就是在此行这大可憎的事，使我远离我的圣所，你看见了吗？你还要看见另有大可憎的事。” He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 他领我到院门口。我观看，见墙上有个窟窿。 And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 他对我说：“人子啊！你要挖墙。”我一挖墙，见有一门。 Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他说：“你进去，看他们在这里所行可憎的恶事。” And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 我进去一看，谁知，在四面墙上画着各样爬物和可憎的走兽，并以色列家一切的偶像。 So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 在这些像前，有以色列家的七十个长老站立，沙番的儿子雅撒尼亚也站在其中。各人手拿香炉，烟云的香气上腾。 And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他对我说：“人子啊！以色列家的长老暗中在各人画像屋里所行的，你看见了吗？他们常说，耶和华看不见我们，耶和华已经离弃这地。” Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他又说：“你还要看见他们另外行大可憎的事。” He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他领我到耶和华殿外院朝北的门口。谁知，在那里有妇女坐着，为搭模斯哭泣。 Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 他对我说：“人子啊！你看见了吗？你还要看见比这更可憎的事。” Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 他又领我到耶和华殿的内院。谁知，在耶和华的殿门口，廊子和祭坛中间，约有二十五个人，背向耶和华的殿，面向东方，拜日头。 And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 他对我说：“人子啊！你看见了吗？犹大家在此行这可憎的事，还算为小吗？他们在这地遍行强暴，再三惹我发怒，他们手拿枝条举向鼻前。 Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 因此，我也要以忿怒行事，我眼必不顾惜，也不可怜他们。他们虽向我耳中大声呼求，我还是不听。” Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor26_9">以西结书 9</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 他向我耳中大声喊叫说：“要使那监管这城的人，手中各拿灭命的兵器前来。” He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 忽然有六个人，从朝北的上门而来，各人手拿杀人的兵器。内中有一人身穿细麻衣，腰间带着墨盒子，他们进来站在铜祭坛旁。 And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 以色列　神的荣耀本在基路伯上，现今从那里升到殿的门槛。　神将那身穿细麻衣，腰间带着墨盒子的人召来。 And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 耶和华对他说：“你去走遍耶路撒冷全城，那些因城中所行可憎之事叹息哀哭的人，画记号在额上。” And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 我耳中听见他对其余的人说：“要跟随他走遍全城，以行击杀。你们的眼不要顾惜，也不要可怜他们。 And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 要将年老的，年少的，并处女、婴孩和妇女，从圣所起全都杀尽；只是凡有记号的人不要挨近他。”于是他们从殿前的长老杀起。 Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 他对他们说：“要污秽这殿，使院中充满被杀的人。你们出去吧！”他们就出去，在城中击杀。 And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 他们击杀的时候，我被留下，我就俯伏在地，说：“哎，主耶和华啊！你将忿怒倾在耶路撒冷，岂要将以色列所剩下的人都灭绝吗？” And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 他对我说：“以色列家和犹大家的罪孽，极其重大。遍地有流血的事，满城有冤屈；因为他们说：‘耶和华已经离弃这地，他看不见我们。’ Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 故此，我眼必不顾惜，也不可怜他们，要照他们所行的报应在他们头上。” And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 那穿细麻衣，腰间带着墨盒子的人，将这事回复说：“我已经照你所吩咐的行了。” And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor26_10">以西结书 10</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 我观看，见基路伯头上的穹苍之中，显出蓝宝石的形状，仿佛宝座的形象。 Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 主对那穿细麻衣的人说：“你进去，在旋转的轮内基路伯以下，从基路伯中间将火炭取满两手，撒在城上。”我就见他进去。 And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 那人进去的时候，基路伯站在殿的右边，云彩充满了内院。 Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 耶和华的荣耀从基路伯那里上升，停在门槛以上。殿内满了云彩，院宇也被耶和华荣耀的光辉充满。 Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD's glory.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 基路伯翅膀的响声听到外院，好象全能　神说话的声音。 And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 他吩咐那穿细麻衣的人说：“要从旋转的轮内基路伯中间取火。”那人就进去站在一个轮子旁边。 And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 有一个基路伯，从基路伯中伸手到基路伯中间的火那里，取些放在那穿细麻衣的人两手中，那人就拿出去了。 And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 在基路伯翅膀之下，显出有人手的样式。 And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 我又观看，见基路伯旁边有四个轮子。这基路伯旁有一个轮子，那基路伯旁有一个轮子，每基路伯都是如此；轮子的颜色(原文作“形状”)仿佛水苍玉。 And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 至于四轮的形状，都是一个样式，仿佛轮中套轮。 And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 轮行走的时候，向四方都能直行，并不掉转。头向何方，他们也随向何方，行走的时候并不掉转。 When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他们全身，连背带手和翅膀，并轮周围，都满了眼睛。这四个基路伯的轮子，都是如此。 And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 至于这些轮子，我耳中听见说。是旋转的。 As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 基路伯各有四脸：第一是基路伯的脸，第二是人的脸，第三是狮子的脸，第四是鹰的脸。 And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 基路伯升上去了，这是我在迦巴鲁河边所见的活物。 And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 基路伯行走，轮也在旁边行走。基路伯展开翅膀，离地上升，轮也不转离他们旁边。 And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 我也使你身穿绣花衣服，脚穿海狗皮鞋，并用细麻布给你束腰，用丝绸为衣披在你身上。 I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 又用妆饰打扮你，将镯子戴在你手上，将金链戴在你项上。 I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 我也将环子戴在你鼻子上，将耳环戴在你耳朵上，将华冠戴在你头上。 And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 这样，你就有金银的妆饰，穿的是细麻衣和丝绸，并绣花衣；吃的是细面、蜂蜜，并油。你也极其美貌，发达到王后的尊荣。 Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 你美貌的名声传在列邦中，你十分美貌，是因我加在你身上的威荣。这是主耶和华说的。 And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: “‘只是你仗着自己的美貌，又因你的名声就行邪淫。你纵情淫乱，使过路的任意而行。 But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 你用衣服为自己在高处结彩，在其上行邪淫。这样的事将来必没有，也必不再行了。 And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 你又将我所给你那华美的金银、宝器，为自己制造人像，与他行邪淫。 Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 又用你的绣花衣服给他披上，并将我的膏油和香料摆在他跟前。 And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 又将我赐给你的食物，就是我赐给你吃的细面、油，和蜂蜜，都摆在他跟前为馨香的供物。这是主耶和华说的。 My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord GOD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 因你在一切市口上建造圆顶花楼，在各街上作了高台；你却藐视赏赐，不象妓女。 In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 你行淫与别的妇女相反，因为不是人从你行淫；你既赠送人，人并不赠送你；所以你与别的妇女相反。” And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 你这妓女啊！要听耶和华的话。 Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 主耶和华如此说：“因你的污秽倾泄了，你与你所爱的行淫露出下体，又因你拜一切可憎的偶像，流儿女的血献给他， Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 我就要将你一切相欢相爱的，和你一切所恨的，都聚集来，从四围攻击你。又将你的下体露出，使他们看尽了。 Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 我也要审判你，好象官长审判淫妇和流人血的妇女一样。我因忿怒忌恨，使流血的罪归到你身上。 And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 我又要将你交在他们手中。他们必拆毁你的圆顶花楼，毁坏你的高台，剥去你的衣服，夺取你的华美宝器，留下你赤身露体。 And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: “他们也必带多人来攻击你，用石头打死你，用刀剑刺透你。 They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 用火焚烧你的房屋，在许多妇人眼前向你施行审判。我必使你不再行淫，也不再赠送与人。 And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 这样，我就止息向你发的忿怒，我的忌恨也要离开你，我要安静不再恼怒。 So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 因你不追念你幼年的日子，在这一切的事上向我发烈怒，所以我必照你所行的报应在你头上，你就不再贪淫行那一切可憎的事。这是主耶和华说的。 Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: “凡说俗语的，必用俗语攻击你。说：母亲怎样，女儿也怎样。 Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 你正是你母亲的女儿，厌弃丈夫和儿女；你正是你姐妹的姐妹，厌弃丈夫和儿女。你母亲是赫人，你父亲是亚摩利人。 Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: “你的姐姐是撒玛利亚，她和她的众女住在你左边；你的妹妹是所多玛，她和她的众女住在你右边。 And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 你没有效法她们的行为，也没有照她们可憎的事去作，你以那为小事，你一切所行的倒比她们更坏。 Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: “主耶和华说：我指着我的永生起誓，你妹妹所多玛与她的众女，尚未行你和你众女所行的事。 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 看哪！你妹妹所多玛的罪孽是这样：她和她的众女都心骄气傲，粮食饱足，大享安逸，并没有扶助困苦和穷乏人的手。 Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">50: 她们狂傲，在我面前行可憎的事；我看见便将她们除掉。 And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">51: “撒玛利亚没有犯你一半的罪，你行可憎的事比她更多，使你的姐妹因你所行一切可憎的事，倒显为义。 Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">52: 你既断定你姐妹为义(“为义”或作“当受羞辱”)，就要担当自己的羞辱；因你所犯的罪比她们更为可憎，她们就比你更显为义；你既使你的姐妹显为义，你就要抱愧担当自己的羞辱。 Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">53: “我必叫她们被掳的归回，就是叫所多玛和她的众女，撒玛利亚和她的众女，并你们中间被掳的，都要归回， When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">54: 好使你担当自己的羞辱，并因你一切所行的使她们得安慰，你就抱愧。 That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">55: 你的妹妹所多玛和她的众女，必归回原位；撒玛利亚和她的众女，你和你的众女，也必归回原位。 When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">56: - For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">57: 在你骄傲的日子，你的恶行没有显露以先，你的口就不提你的妹妹所多玛。那受了凌辱的亚兰众女和亚兰四围非利士的众女，都恨恶你，藐视你。 Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">58: 耶和华说：你贪淫和可憎的事，你已经担当了。 Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">59: “主耶和华如此说：你这轻看誓言，背弃盟约的，我必照你所行的待你。 For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">60: 然而我要追念在你幼年时与你所立的约，也要与你立定永约。 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">61: 你接待你姐姐和你妹妹的时候，你要追念你所行的，自觉惭愧。并且我要将她们赐你为女儿，却不是按着前约。 Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">62: 我要坚定与你所立的约(你就知道我是耶和华)， And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">63: 好使你在我赦免你一切所行的时候，心里追念，自觉抱愧，又因你的羞辱就不再开口。这是主耶和华说的。” That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor26_17">以西结书 17</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 人子啊！你要呼喊哀号，因为这刀临到我的百姓和以色列一切的首领。他们和我的百姓都交在刀下，所以你要拍腿叹息。 Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 有试验的事；若那藐视的杖归于无有，怎么样呢？这是主耶和华说的。 Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the rod? it shall be no more, saith the Lord GOD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 因为巴比伦王站在岔路那里，在两条路口上要占卜。他摇签(原文作“箭”)求问神像，察看牺牲的肝。 For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 在右手中拿着为耶路撒冷占卜的签，使他安设撞城锤；张口叫杀，扬声呐喊，筑垒造台，以撞城锤攻打城门。 At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 据那些曾起誓的犹大人看来，这是虚假的占卜；但巴比伦王要使他们想起罪孽，以致将他们捉住。 And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 主耶和华如此说：因你们的过犯显露，使你们的罪孽被记念，以致你们的罪恶在行为上都彰显出来。又因你们被记念，就被捉住。 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: “你这受死伤行恶的以色列王啊！罪孽的尽头到了，受报的日子已到。 And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 我必聚集你们，把我烈怒的火吹在你们身上，你们就在其中熔化。 Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 阿荷拉归我之后行邪淫，贪恋所爱的人，就是她的邻邦亚述人。 And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 这些人都穿蓝衣，作省长、副省长，都骑着马，是可爱的少年人。 Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 阿荷拉就与亚述人中最美的男子放纵淫行；她因所恋爱之人的一切偶像，玷污自己。 Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 自从在埃及的时候，她就没有离开淫乱；因为她年幼作处女的时候，埃及人与她行淫，抚摸她的乳，纵欲与她行淫。 Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 因此，我将她交在她所爱的人手中，就是她所恋爱的亚述人手中。 Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 他们就露了她的下体，掳掠她的儿女，用刀杀了她，使她在妇女中留下臭名；因他们向她施行审判。 These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: “她妹妹阿荷利巴虽然看见了，却还贪恋，比她姐姐更丑；行淫乱，比她姐姐更多。 And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 她贪恋邻邦的亚述人，就是穿极华美的衣服，骑着马的省长、副省长，都是可爱的少年人。 She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 我看见她被玷污了，她姐妹二人同行一路。 Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: “阿荷利巴又加增淫行；因她看见人像画在墙上，就是用丹色所画迦勒底人的像， And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 腰间系着带子，头上有下垂的裹头巾，都是军长的形状，仿照巴比伦人的形象；他们的故土就是迦勒底。 Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 阿荷利巴一看见就贪恋他们，打发使者往迦勒底去见他们。 And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 巴比伦人就来登她爱情的床，与她行淫玷污她。她被玷污，随后心里与他们生疏。 And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 这样，她显露淫行，又显露下体；我心就与她生疏，象先前与她姐姐生疏一样。 So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 她还加增她的淫行，追念她幼年在埃及地行邪淫的日子； Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 贪恋情人，身壮精足，如驴如马。 For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 这样，你就想起你幼年的淫行。那时，埃及人拥抱你的怀，抚摸你的乳。” Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 阿荷利巴啊，主耶和华如此说：“我必激动你先爱而后生疏的人来攻击你。我必使他们来，在你四围攻击你。 Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 所来的就是巴比伦人，迦勒底的众人，比割人，书亚人，哥亚人，同着他们的还有亚述众人，乃是作省长、副省长，作军长有名声的，都骑着马，是可爱的少年人。 The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 他们必带兵器、战车、辎重车，率领大众来攻击你。他们要拿大小盾牌，顶盔摆阵，在你四围攻击你。我要将审判的事交给他们，他们必按着自己的条例审判你。 And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 我必以忌恨攻击你；他们必以忿怒办你。他们必割去你的鼻子和耳朵；你遗留(或作“余剩”。下同。)的人必倒在刀下。他们必掳去你的儿女，你所遗留的必被火焚烧。 And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 他们必剥去你的衣服，夺取你华美的宝器。 They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 这样，我必使你的淫行和你从埃及地染来的淫乱止息了。使你不再仰望亚述，也不再追念埃及。” Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 主耶和华如此说：“我必将你交在你所恨恶的人手中，就是你心与他生疏的人手中。 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 他们必以恨恶办你；夺取你一切劳碌得来的，留下你赤身露体。你淫乱的下体，连你的淫行，带你的淫乱，都被显露。 And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 人必向你行这些事；因为你随从外邦人行邪淫，被他们的偶像玷污了。 I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 你走了你姐姐所走的路，所以我必将她的杯交在你手中。” Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 主耶和华如此说：“你必喝你姐姐所喝的杯；那杯又深又广，盛得甚多，使你被人嗤笑讥刺。 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 你必酩酊大醉，满有愁苦；喝干你姐姐撒玛利亚的杯，就是令人惊骇凄凉的杯。 Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 你必喝这杯，以至喝尽。杯破又啃杯片，撕裂自己的乳。因为这事我曾说过。这是主耶和华说的。” Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 主耶和华如此说：“因你忘记我，将我丢在背后，所以你要担当你淫行和淫乱的报应。” Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 耶和华又对我说：“人子啊！你要审问阿荷拉与阿荷利巴吗？当指出她们所行可憎的事。 The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 她们行淫，手中有杀人的血，又与偶像行淫，并使她们为我所生的儿女经火烧给偶像。 That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 此外，她们还有向我所行的，就是同日玷污我的圣所，干犯我的安息日。 Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 她们杀了儿女献与偶像，当天又入我的圣所，将圣所亵渎了。她们在我殿中所行的乃是如此。 For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: “况且你们二妇打发使者去请远方人。使者到他们那里，他们就来了。你们为他们沐浴己身，粉饰眼目，佩戴妆饰。 And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 坐在华美的床上，前面摆设桌案，将我的香料膏油摆在其上。 And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 在那里有群众安逸欢乐的声音，并有粗俗的人和酒徒，从旷野同来，把镯子戴在二妇的手上，把华冠戴在她们的头上。 And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 我论这行淫衰老的妇人说：现在人还要与她行淫，她也要与人行淫。 Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 人与阿荷拉，并阿荷利巴二淫妇苟合，好象与妓女苟合。 Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 必有义人，照审判淫妇和流人血的妇人之例，审判她们，因为她们是淫妇，手中有杀人的血。” And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 主耶和华如此说：“我必使多人来攻击她们，使她们抛来抛去，被人抢夺。 For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 这些人必用石头打死她们，用刀剑杀害她们，又杀戮她们的儿女，用火焚烧她们的房屋。 And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 这样，我必使淫行从境内止息，好叫一切妇人都受警戒，不效法你们的淫行。 Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 人必照着你们的淫行报应你们；你们要担当拜偶像的罪，就知道我是主耶和华。” And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor26_24">以西结书 24</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 第九年十月初十日，耶和华的话又临到我说： Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: “人子啊！今日正是巴比伦王就近耶路撒冷的日子，你要将这日记下。 Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 要向这悖逆之家设比喻，说，主耶和华如此说：将锅放在火上，放好了，就倒水在其中。 And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 将肉块，就是一切肥美的肉块，腿和肩，都聚在其中，拿美好的骨头把锅装满。 Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 取羊群中最好的，将柴堆在锅下，使锅开滚，好把骨头煮在其中。” Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 主耶和华如此说：“祸哉！这流人血的城，就是长锈的锅。其中的锈未曾除掉，须要将肉块从其中一一取出来，不必为它拈阄。 Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 城中所流的血，倒在净光的磐石上，不倒在地上，用土掩盖。 For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 这城中所流的血倒在净光的磐石上，不得掩盖，乃是出于我，为要发忿怒施行报应。” That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 所以主耶和华如此说：“祸哉！这流人血的城，我也必大堆火柴。 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 添上木柴，使火着旺，将肉煮烂，把汤熬浓，使骨头烤焦。 Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 把锅倒空坐在炭火上，使锅烧热，使铜烧红，熔化其中的污秽，除净其上的锈。 Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 这锅劳碌疲乏，所长的大锈仍未除掉；这锈就是用火也不能除掉。 She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 在你污秽中有淫行；我洁净你，你却不洁净。你的污秽再不能洁净，直等我向你发的忿怒止息。 In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 我耶和华说过的，必定成就，必照话而行，必不返回，必不顾惜，也不后悔。人必照你的举动行为审判你。这是主耶和华说的。” I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 耶和华的话又临到我说： Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: “人子啊！我要将你眼目所喜爱的忽然取去，你却不可悲哀哭泣，也不可流泪。 Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 于是我将这事早晨告诉百姓，晚上我的妻就死了。次日早晨我便遵命而行。 So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 百姓问我说：“你这样行与我们有什么关系，你不告诉我们吗？” And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 我回答他们：“耶和华的话临到我说： Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: ‘你告诉以色列家，主耶和华如此说，我必使我的圣所，就是你们势力所夸耀，眼里所喜爱，心中所爱惜的被亵渎；并且你们所遗留的儿女，必倒在刀下。 Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 我必将埃及人分散在列国，四散在列邦。 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 我必使巴比伦王的膀臂有力，将我的刀交在他手中；却要打断法老的膀臂，他就在巴比伦王面前唉哼，如同受死伤的人一样。 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: “人子啊！你要向埃及王法老和他的众人说：在威势上谁能与你相比呢？ Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 亚述王曾如黎巴嫩中的香柏树，枝条荣美，影密如林，极其高大，树尖插入云中。 Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 众水使它生长，深水使它长大。所栽之地有江河围流，汊出的水道，延到田野诸树。 The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 所以它高大超过田野诸树，发旺的时候，枝子繁多；因得大水之力枝条长长。 Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 空中的飞鸟，都在枝子上搭窝；田野的走兽，都在枝条下生子；所有大国的人民，都在它荫下居住。 All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 树大条长，成为荣美，因为根在众水之旁。 Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 　神园中的香柏树不能遮蔽它，松树不及它的枝子，枫树不及它的枝条；　神园中的树，都没有它荣美。 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 我使它的枝条蕃多，成为荣美，以致　神伊甸园中的树都嫉妒它。” I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 所以主耶和华如此说：“因它高大，树尖插入云中，心骄气傲， Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 我就必将它交给列国中大有威势的人，他必定办它；我因它的罪恶，已经驱逐它。 I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 外邦人，就是列邦中强暴的，将它砍断弃掉，它的枝条落在山间和一切谷中；它的枝子折断，落在地的一切河旁。地上的众民已经走去，离开它的荫下。 And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 空中的飞鸟，都要宿在这败落的树上；田野的走兽，都要卧在它的枝条下。 Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 好使水旁的诸树，不因高大而自尊，也不将树尖插入云中。并且那些得水滋润有势力的，也不得高大自立；因为它们在世人中，和下坑的人都被交与死亡，到阴府去了。” To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 主耶和华如此说：“它下阴间的那日，我便使人悲哀。我为它遮盖深渊，使江河凝结，大水停流；我也使黎巴嫩为它凄惨，田野的诸树，都因它发昏。 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 我将它扔到阴间，与下坑的人一同下去。那时，列国听见它坠落的响声，就都震动，并且伊甸的一切树，就是黎巴嫩得水滋润最佳最美的树，都在阴府受了安慰。 I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 它们也与它同下阴间，到被杀的人那里。它们曾作它的膀臂，在列国中它的荫下居住。 They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 他们必不再作外邦人的掠物，地上的野兽也不再吞吃他们。却要安然居住，无人惊吓。 And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 所以我因他们在那地上流人的血，又因他们以偶像玷污那地，就把我的忿怒倾在他们身上。 Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 我将他们分散在列国，四散在列邦，按他们的行动作为惩罚他们。 And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 他们到了所去的列国，就使我的圣名被亵渎；因为人谈论他们说，这是耶和华的民，是从耶和华的地出来的。 And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 我却顾惜我的圣名，就是以色列家在所到的列国中所亵渎的。 But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: “所以你要对以色列家说，主耶和华如此说：以色列家啊！我行这事不是为你们，乃是为我的圣名，就是在你们到的列国中所亵渎的。 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 我要使我的大名显为圣；这名在列国中已被亵渎，就是你们在他们中间所亵渎的。我在他们眼前，在你们身上显为圣的时候，他们就知道我是耶和华。这是主耶和华说的。 And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 我必从各国收取你们，从列邦聚集你们，引导你们归回本地。 For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 我必用清水洒在你们身上，你们就洁净了。我要洁净你们，使你们脱离一切的污秽，弃掉一切的偶像。 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 我也要赐给你们一个新心，将新灵放在你们里面。又从你们的肉体中除掉石心，赐给你们肉心。 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 我必将我的灵，放在你们里面，使你们顺从我的律例，谨守遵行我的典章。 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 你们必住在我所赐给你们列祖之地。你们要作我的子民，我要作你们的　神。 And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 我必救你们脱离一切的污秽，也必命五谷丰登，不使你们遭遇饥荒。 I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 我必使树木多结果子，田地多出土产，好叫你们不再因饥荒受外邦人的讥诮。 And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 那时，你们必追想你们的恶行和你们不善的作为，就因你们的罪孽和可憎的事厌恶自己。 Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 主耶和华说：你们要知道我这样行，不是为你们。以色列家啊！当为自己的行为，抱愧蒙羞。” Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 主耶和华如此说：“我洁净你们，使你们脱离一切罪孽的日子，必使城邑有人居住，荒场再被建造。 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 过路的人，虽看为荒废之地，现今这荒废之地，仍得耕种。 And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 他们必说：‘这先前为荒废之地，现在成如伊甸园；这荒废凄凉毁坏的城邑，现在坚固有人居住。’ And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 那时，在你们四围其余的外邦人，必知道我耶和华修造那毁坏之处，培植那荒废之地。我耶和华说过，也必成就。” Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 主耶和华如此说：“我要加增以色列家的人数，多如羊群。他们必为这事向我求问，我要给他们成就。 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 耶路撒冷在守节作祭物所献的羊群怎样多；照样，荒凉的城邑必被人群充满，他们就知道我是耶和华。” As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the LORD.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor26_37">以西结书 37</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 他使我从骸骨的四围经过，谁知在平原的骸骨甚多，而且极其枯干。 And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 在北门旁，内院里有屋子，为歌唱的人而设。这屋子朝南；在南门旁，又有一间朝北(“南”原文作“东”)。 And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">45: 他对我说：“这朝南的屋子，是为看守殿宇的祭司。 And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">46: 那朝北的屋子是为看守祭坛的祭司。这些祭司，是利未人中撒督的子孙，近前来事奉耶和华的。” And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">47: 他又量内院，长一百肘，宽一百肘，是见方的。祭坛在殿前。 So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">48: 于是他带我到殿前的廊子，量廊子的墙柱。这面厚五肘，那面厚五肘。门两旁，这边三肘，那边三肘。 And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">49: 廊子长二十肘，宽十一肘。上廊子有台阶。靠近墙柱，又有柱子；这边一根，那边一根。 The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor26_41">以西结书 41</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 他带我到殿那里，量墙柱：这面厚六肘，那面厚六肘，宽窄与会幕相同。 Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 门口宽十肘。门两旁，这边五肘，那边五肘。他量殿长四十肘，宽二十肘。 And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他量内殿，长二十肘，宽二十肘。他对我说：“这是至圣所。” So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 他又量殿墙：厚六肘；围着殿有旁屋，各宽四肘。 After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 旁屋有三层，层叠而上，每层排列三十间。旁屋的梁木搁在殿墙坎上，免得插入殿墙。 And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 这围殿的旁屋，越高越宽，因旁屋围殿悬叠而上；所以越上越宽，从下一层，由中一层，到上一层。 And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 我又见围着殿有高月台。旁屋的根基，高足一竿，就是六大肘。 I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 旁屋的外墙厚五肘。旁屋之外，还有余地。 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 在旁屋与对面的房屋中间有空地，宽二十肘。 And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 旁屋的门，都向余地；一门向北，一门向南；周围的余地宽五肘。 And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 在西面空地之后有房子，宽七十肘，长九十肘，墙四围厚五肘。 Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 这样，他量殿，长一百肘。又量空地和那房子，并墙，共长一百肘。 So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 殿的前面和两旁的空地，宽一百肘。 Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 他量空地后面的那房子，并两旁的楼廊，共长一百肘。 And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 内殿，院廊，门槛，严紧的窗棂，并对着门槛的三层楼廊，从地到窗棂(窗棂都有蔽子)， The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 直到门以上。就是到内殿和外殿内外四围墙壁，都按尺寸用木板遮蔽。 To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 墙上雕刻基路伯和棕树。每二基路伯中间有一棵棕树，每基路伯有二脸。 And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 这边有人脸向着棕树，那边有狮子脸向着棕树，殿内周围，都是如此。 So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 从地至门以上，都有基路伯和棕树。殿墙就是这样。 From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 殿的门柱是方的。至圣所的前面，形状和殿的形状一样。 The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 坛是木头作的，高三肘，长二肘。坛角和坛面，并四旁，都是木头作的。他对我说：“这是耶和华面前的桌子。” The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 殿和至圣所的门，各有两扇。 And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 每扇分两扇，这两扇是折叠的。这边门分两扇，那边门也分两扇。 And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 殿的门扇上雕刻基路伯和棕树，与刻在墙上的一般。在外头廊前有木槛。 And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 廊这边那边，都有严紧的窗棂和棕树。殿的旁屋和槛，就是这样。 And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor26_42">以西结书 42</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 他带我出来向北，到外院。又带我进入圣屋；这圣屋一排顺着空地，一排与北边铺石地之屋相对。 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 这圣屋长一百肘，宽五十肘，有向北的门。 Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 对着内院那二十肘宽之空地，又对着外院的铺石地。在第三层楼上，有楼廊对着楼廊。 Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 在圣屋前有一条夹道，宽十肘，长一百肘。房门都向北。 And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 圣屋因为楼廊占去些地方，所以上层比中下两层窄些。 Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 圣屋有三层，却无柱子，不象外院的屋子有柱子；所以上层比中下两层更窄。 For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 圣屋外，东边有墙，靠着外院，长五十肘。 And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 靠着外院的圣屋，长五十肘。殿北面的圣屋，长一百肘。 For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 向南(原文作“东”)在内院墙里有圣屋，一排与铺石地之屋相对，一排顺着空地。 The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 这圣屋前的夹道，与北边圣屋的夹道长宽一样；出入之处，与北屋门的样式相同。 And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 正在墙前，夹道的东头，有门可以进入，与向南圣屋的门一样。 And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他对我说：“顺着空地的南屋北屋，都是圣屋；亲近耶和华的祭司，当在那里吃至圣的物。也当在那里放至圣的物，就是素祭、赎罪祭和赎愆祭。因此处为圣。 Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 祭司进去出了圣所的时候，不可直到外院，但要在圣屋放下他们供职的衣服，因为是圣衣。要穿上别的衣服，才可以到属民的外院。” When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 他量完了内殿，就带我出朝东的门，量院的四围。 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 他用量度的竿量四围，量东面五百肘(原文作“竿”，本章下同。)。 He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray;
