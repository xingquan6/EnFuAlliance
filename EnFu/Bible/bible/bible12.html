And Elijah departed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 使者回来见王，王问他们说：“你们为什么回来呢？” And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 使者回答说：“有一个人迎着我们来，对我们说：‘你们回去见差你们来的王，对他说，耶和华如此说，你差人去问以革伦神巴力西卜，岂因以色列中没有　神吗？所以你必不下所上的床，必定要死。’” And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 王问他们说：“迎着你们来告诉你们这话的，是怎样的人？” And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 回答说：“他身穿毛衣，腰束皮带。”王说：“这必是提斯比人以利亚。” And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 于是王差遣五十夫长，带领五十人去见以利亚，他就上到以利亚那里，以利亚正坐在山顶上。五十夫长对他说：“神人哪！王吩咐你下来。” Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 以利亚回答说：“我若是神人，愿火从天上降下来，烧灭你和你那五十人。”于是有火从天上降下来，烧灭五十夫长和他那五十人。 And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 王第二次差遣一个五十夫长，带领五十人去见以利亚。五十夫长对以利亚说：“神人哪！王吩咐你快快下来。” Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 以利亚回答说：“我若是神人，愿火从天上降下来，烧灭你和你那五十人。”于是　神的火从天上降下来，烧灭五十夫长和他那五十人。 And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 王第三次差遣一个五十夫长，带领五十人去。这五十夫长上去双膝跪在以利亚面前，哀求他，说：“神人哪！愿我的性命和你这五十个仆人的性命，在你眼前看为宝贵。 And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 已经有火从天上降下来，烧灭前两次来的五十夫长和他们各自带的五十人；现在愿我的性命在你眼前看为宝贵。” Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 耶和华的使者对以利亚说：“你同着他下去，不要怕他。”以利亚就起来，同着他下去见王。 And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 对王说：“耶和华如此说，你差人去问以革伦神巴力西卜，岂因以色列中没有　神可以求问吗？所以你必不下所上的床，必定要死。” And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 亚哈谢果然死了，正如耶和华藉以利亚所说的话。因他没有儿子，他兄弟约兰接续他作王，正在犹大王约沙法的儿子约兰第二年。 So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 亚哈谢其余所行的事，都写在以色列诸王记上。 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor12_2">列王纪下 2</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 耶和华要用旋风接以利亚升天的时候，以利亚与以利沙从吉甲前往。 And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 以利亚对以利沙说：“耶和华差我往伯特利去，你可以在这里等候。”以利沙说：“我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我必不离开你。”于是二人下到伯特利。 And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 住伯特利的先知门徒出来见以利沙，对他说：“耶和华今日要接你的师傅离开你，你知道不知道？”他说：“我知道，你们不要作声。” And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 以利亚对以利沙说：“耶和华差遣我往耶利哥去，你可以在这里等候。”以利沙说：“我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我必不离开你。”于是二人到了耶利哥。 And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 住耶利哥的先知门徒就近以利沙，对他说：“耶和华今日要接你的师傅离开你，你知道不知道？”他说：“我知道，你们不要作声。” And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 以利亚对以利沙说：“耶和华差遣我往约但河去，你可以在这里等候。”以利沙说：“我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我必不离开你。”于是二人一同前往。 And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 有先知门徒去了五十人，远远地站在他们对面；二人在约但河边站住。 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 以利亚将自己的外衣卷起来，用以打水，水就左右分开，二人走干地而过。 And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 过去之后，以利亚对以利沙说：“我未曾被接去离开你，你要我为你作什么只管求我！”以利沙说：“愿感动你的灵加倍地感动我。” And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 以利亚说：“你所求的难得！虽然如此，我被接去离开你的时候，你若看见我，就必得着；不然，必得不着了。” And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 他们正走着说话，忽有火车火马，将二人隔开，以利亚就乘旋风升天去了。 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 以利沙看见，就呼叫说：“我父啊！我父啊！以色列的战车马兵啊！”以后不再见他了。于是以利沙把自己的衣服撕为两片。 And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他拾起以利亚身上掉下来的外衣，回去站在约但河边。 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他用以利亚身上掉下来的外衣打水，说：“耶和华，以利亚的　神在哪里呢？”打水之后，水也左右分开，以利沙就过来了。 And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 住耶利哥的先知门徒从对面看见他，就说：“感动以利亚的灵感动以利沙了！”他们就来迎接他，在他面前俯伏于地。 And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 对他说：“仆人们这里有五十个壮士，求你容他们去寻找你师傅，或者耶和华的灵将他提起来，投在某山某谷。”以利沙说：“你们不必打发人去。” And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 他们再三催促他，他难以推辞，就说：“你们打发人去吧！”他们便打发五十人去，寻找了三天，也没有找着。 And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 以利沙仍然在耶利哥，等候他们回到他那里；他对他们说：“我岂没有告诉你们，不必去吗？” And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 耶利哥城的人对以利沙说：“这城的地势美好，我主看见了；只是水恶劣，土产不熟而落。” And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 以利沙说：“你们拿一个新瓶来装盐给我。”他们就拿来给他。 And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 他出到水源，将盐倒在水中，说：“耶和华如此说：‘我治好了这水，从此必不再使人死，也不再使地土不生产。’” And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 于是那水治好了，直到今日，正如以利沙所说的。 So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 以利沙从那里上伯特利去，正上去的时候，有些童子从城里出来，戏笑他说：“秃头的上去吧！秃头的上去吧！” And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 他回头看见，就奉耶和华的名咒诅他们。于是有两个母熊从林中出来，撕裂他们中间四十二个童子。 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 以利沙从伯特利上迦密山，又从迦密山回到撒玛利亚。 And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor12_3">列王纪下 3</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 犹大王约沙法十八年，亚哈的儿子约兰在撒玛利亚登基，作了以色列王十二年。 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，但不至象他父母所行的，因为除掉他父所造巴力的柱像。 And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 然而，他贴近尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪，总不离开。 Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 摩押王米沙牧养许多羊，每年将十万羊羔的毛和十万公绵羊的毛给以色列王进贡。 And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 亚哈死后，摩押王背叛以色列王。 But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 那时约兰王出撒玛利亚，数点以色列众人。 And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 前行的时候，差人去见犹大王约沙法，说：“摩押王背叛我，你肯同我去攻打摩押吗？”他说：“我肯上去，你我不分彼此，我的民与你的民一样，我的马与你的马一样。” And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 约兰说：“我们从哪条路上去呢？”回答说：“从以东旷野的路上去。” And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 于是，以色列王和犹大王，并以东王，都一同去绕行七日的路程，军队和所带的牲畜没有水喝。 So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 以色列王说：“哀哉！耶和华招聚我们这三王，乃要交在摩押人的手里。” And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 约沙法说：“这里不是有耶和华的先知吗？我们可以托他求问耶和华。”以色列王的一个臣子回答说：“这里有沙法的儿子以利沙，就是从前服侍以利亚的(原文作“倒水在以利亚手上的”)。” But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 约沙法说：“他必有耶和华的话。”于是以色列王和约沙法，并以东王都下去见他。 And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 以利沙对以色列王说：“我与你何干？去问你父亲的先知和你母亲的先知吧！”以色列王对他说：“不要这样说，耶和华招聚我们这三王，乃要交在摩押人的手里。” And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 以利沙说：“我指着所事奉永生的万军耶和华起誓，我若不看犹大王约沙法的情面，必不理你，不顾你。 And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 现在你们给我找一个弹琴的来。”弹琴的时候，耶和华的灵(原文作“手”)就降在以利沙身上。 But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 他便说：“耶和华如此说：‘你们要在这谷中满处挖沟。 And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 因为耶和华如此说：你们虽不见风，不见雨，这谷必满了水，使你们和牲畜有水喝。’ For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 在耶和华眼中这还算为小事，他也必将摩押人交在你们手中。 And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 你们必攻破一切坚城美邑，砍伐各种佳树，塞住一切水泉，用石头糟踏一切美田。” And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 次日早晨，约在献祭的时候，有水从以东而来，遍地就满了水。 And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 摩押众人听见这三王上来要与他们争战，凡能顶盔贯甲的，无论老少，尽都聚集站在边界上。 And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 次日早晨，日光照在水上，摩押人起来，看见对面水红如血， And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 就说：“这是血啊！必是三王互相击杀，俱都灭亡。摩押人哪！我们现在去抢夺财物吧！” And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 摩押人到了以色列营，以色列人就起来攻打他们，以致他们在以色列人面前逃跑。以色列人往前追杀摩押人，直杀入摩押的境内， And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 拆毁摩押的城邑，各人抛石填满一切美田，塞住一切水泉，砍伐各种佳树，只剩下吉珥哈列设的石墙；甩石的兵在四围攻打那城。 And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 摩押王见阵势甚大，难以对敌，就率领七百拿刀的兵，要冲过阵去到以东王那里，却是不能； And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 便将那应当接续他作王的长子，在城上献为燔祭。以色列人遭遇耶和华的大怒(或作“招人痛恨”)，于是三王离开摩押王，各回本国去了。 Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor12_4">列王纪下 4</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 有一个先知门徒的妻，哀求以利沙说：“你仆人我丈夫死了，他敬畏耶和华是你所知道的。现在有债主来，要取我两个儿子作奴仆。” Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 以利沙问她说：“我可以为你作什么呢？你告诉我，你家里有什么？”她说：“婢女家中，除了一瓶油之外，没有什么。” And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 以利沙说：“你去，向你众邻舍借空器皿，不要少借。 Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 回到家里，关上门，你和你儿子在里面，将油倒在所有的器皿里，倒满了的放在一边。” And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 于是妇人离开以利沙去了，关上门，自己和儿子在里面，儿子把器皿拿来，她就倒油。 So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 器皿都满了，她对儿子说：“再给我拿器皿来。”儿子说：“再没有器皿了。”油就止住了。 And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 妇人去告诉神人。神人说：“你去卖油还债，所剩的，你和你儿子可以靠着度日。” Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 一日，以利沙走到书念，在那里有一个大户的妇人，强留他吃饭。此后，以利沙每从那里经过，就进去吃饭。 And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 妇人对丈夫说：“我看出那常从我们这里经过的，是圣洁的神人。 And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 我们可以为他在墙上盖一间小楼，在其中安放床榻、桌子、椅子、灯台，他来到我们这里，就可以住在其间。” Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 一日，以利沙来到那里，就进了那楼躺卧。 And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 以利沙吩咐仆人基哈西说：“你叫这书念妇人来。”他就把妇人叫了来，妇人站在以利沙面前。 And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 以利沙吩咐仆人说：“你对她说：你既为我们费了许多心思，可以为你作什么呢？你向王，或元帅，有所求的没有？”她回答说：“我在我本乡安居无事。” And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 以利沙对仆人说：“究竟当为她作什么呢？”基哈西说：“她没有儿子，她丈夫也老了。” And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 以利沙说：“再叫她来。”于是叫了她来，她就站在门口。 And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 以利沙说：“明年到这时候，你必抱一个儿子。”她说：“神人，我主啊！不要那样欺哄婢女。” And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 妇人果然怀孕，到了那时候，生了一个儿子，正如以利沙所说的。 And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 孩子渐渐长大，一日到他父亲和收割的人那里， And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 他对父亲说：“我的头啊！我的头啊！”他父亲对仆人说：“把他抱到他母亲那里。” And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 仆人抱去，交给他母亲，孩子坐在母亲的膝上，到晌午就死了。 And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 他母亲抱他上了楼，将他放在神人的床上，关上门出来， And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 呼叫她丈夫说：“你叫一个仆人给我牵一匹驴来，我要快快地去见神人，就回来。” And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 丈夫说：“今日不是月朔，也不是安息日，你为何要去见他呢？”妇人说：“平安无事。” And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 于是备上驴，对仆人说：“你快快赶着走，我若不吩咐你，就不要迟慢！” Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 妇人就往迦密山去见神人。神人远远地看见她，对仆人基哈西说：“看哪！书念的妇人来了。 So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 你跑去迎接她，问她说：‘你平安吗？你丈夫平安吗？孩子平安吗？’”她说：“平安。” Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 妇人上了山，到神人那里，就抱住神人的脚。基哈西前来要推开她，神人说：“由她吧！因为她心里愁苦，耶和华向我隐瞒，没有指示我。” And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 妇人说：“我何尝向我主求过儿子呢？我岂没有说过，不要欺哄我吗？” Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 以利沙吩咐基哈西说：“你束上腰，手拿我的杖前去；若遇见人，不要向他问安；人若向你问安，也不要回答；要把我的杖放在孩子脸上。” Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 孩子的母亲说：“我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我必不离开你。”于是以利沙起身，随着她去了。 And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 基哈西先去，把杖放在孩子脸上，却没有声音，也没有动静。基哈西就迎着以利沙回来，告诉他说：“孩子还没有醒过来。” And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 以利沙来到，进了屋子，看见孩子死了，放在自己的床上。 And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 他就关上门，只有自己和孩子在里面，他便祈祷耶和华， He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 上床伏在孩子身上，口对口，眼对眼，手对手；既伏在孩子身上，孩子的身体就渐渐温和了。 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 然后他下来，在屋里来往走了一趟，又上去伏在孩子身上，孩子打了七个喷嚏，就睁开眼睛了。 Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 以利沙叫基哈西说：“你叫这书念妇人来。”于是叫了她来。以利沙说：“将你儿子抱起来！” And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 妇人就进来，在以利沙脚前俯伏于地，抱起她儿子出去了。 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 以利沙又来到吉甲，那地正有饥荒，先知门徒坐在他面前。他吩咐仆人说：“你将大锅放在火上，给先知门徒熬汤。” And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 有一个人去到田野掐菜，遇见一棵野瓜藤，就摘了一兜野瓜；回来切了，搁在熬汤的锅中，因为他们不知道是什么东西。 And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 倒出来给众人吃，吃的时候，都喊叫说：“神人哪！锅中有致死的毒物。”所以众人不能吃了。 So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 以利沙说：“拿点面来。”就把面撒在锅中，说：“倒出来，给众人吃吧！”锅中就没有毒了。 But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">42: 有一个人从巴力沙利沙来，带着初熟大麦作的饼二十个，并新穗子，装在口袋里，送给神人。神人说：“把这些给众人吃。” And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">43: 仆人说：“这一点岂可摆给一百人吃呢？”以利沙说：“你只管给众人吃吧！因为耶和华如此说，众人必吃了，还剩下。” And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">44: 仆人就摆在众人面前，他们吃了，果然还剩下，正如耶和华所说的。 So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor12_5">列王纪下 5</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 亚兰王的元帅乃缦，在他主人面前为尊为大，因耶和华曾藉他使亚兰人得胜；他又是大能的勇士，只是长了大麻风。 Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 先前亚兰人成群地出去，从以色列国掳了一个小女子，这女子就服事乃缦的妻。 And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 她对主母说：“巴不得我主人去见撒玛利亚的先知，必能治好他的大麻风。” And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 乃缦进去，告诉他主人说，以色列国的女子如此如此说。 And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 亚兰王说：“你可以去，我也达信于以色列王。”于是乃缦带银子十他连得，金子六千舍客勒，衣裳十套，就去了。 And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 且带信给以色列王，信上说：“我打发臣仆乃缦去见你，你接到这信，就要治好他的大麻风。” And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 以色列王看了信，就撕裂衣服，说：“我岂是　神，能使人死，使人活呢？这人竟打发人来，叫我治好他的大麻风。你们看一看，这人何以寻隙攻击我呢？” And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 神人以利沙听见以色列王撕裂衣服，就打发人去见王，说：“你为什么撕了衣服呢？可使那人到我这里来，他就知道以色列中有先知了。” And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 于是乃缦带着车马到了以利沙的家，站在门前。 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 以利沙打发一个使者，对乃缦说：“你去在约但河中沐浴七回，你的肉就必复原，而得洁净。” And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 乃缦却发怒走了，说：“我想他必定出来见我，站着求告耶和华他　神的名，在患处以上摇手，治好这大麻风。 But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 大马色的河亚罢拿和法珥法，岂不比以色列的一切水更好吗？我在那里沐浴不得洁净吗？”于是气忿忿地转身去了。 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他的仆人进前来，对他说：“我父啊！先知若吩咐你作一件大事，你岂不作吗？何况说你去沐浴而得洁净呢！” And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 于是乃缦下去，照着神人的话，在约但河里沐浴七回；他的肉复原，好象小孩子的肉，他就洁净了。 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 乃缦带着一切跟随他的人，回到神人那里，站在他面前说：“如今我知道，除了以色列之外，普天下没有　神。现在求你收点仆人的礼物。” And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 以利沙说：“我指着所事奉永生的耶和华起誓，我必不受。”乃缦再三地求他，他却不受。 But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 乃缦说：“你若不肯受，请将两骡子驮的土赐给仆人。从今以后，仆人必不再将燔祭或平安祭献与别神，只献给耶和华。 And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 惟有一件事，愿耶和华饶恕你仆人：我主人进临门庙叩拜的时候，我用手搀他在临门庙，我也屈身。我在临门庙屈身的这事，愿耶和华饶恕我。” In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 以利沙对他说：“你可以平平安安地回去。”乃缦就离开他去了，走了不远。 And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 神人以利沙的仆人基哈西心里说：“我主人不愿从这亚兰人乃缦手里受他带来的礼物，我指着永生的耶和华起誓，我必跑去追上他，向他要些。” But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 于是基哈西追赶乃缦。乃缦看见有人追赶，就急忙下车迎着他，说：“都平安吗？” So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 说：“都平安。我主人打发我来说，刚才有两个少年人，是先知门徒，从以法莲山地来见我，请你赐他们一他连得银子，两套衣裳。” And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 乃缦说：“请受二他连得。”再三地请受，便将二他连得银子装在两个口袋里，又将两套衣裳交给两个仆人，他们就在基哈西前头抬着走。 And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 到了山冈，基哈西从他们手中接过来，放在屋里，打发他们回去。 And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 基哈西进去，站在他主人面前。以利沙问他说：“基哈西你从哪里来？”回答说：“仆人没有往哪里去。” But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 以利沙对他说：“那人下车转回迎你的时候，我的心岂没有去呢？这岂是受银子、衣裳、买橄榄园、葡萄园、牛羊、仆婢的时候呢？ And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 因此，乃缦的大麻风必沾染你和你的后裔，直到永远。”基哈西从以利沙面前退出去，就长了大麻风，象雪那样白。 The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor12_6">列王纪下 6</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 先知门徒对以利沙说：“看哪！我们同你所住的地方过于窄小， And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 求你容我们往约但河去，各人从那里取一根木料建造房屋居住。”他说：“你们去吧！” Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 有一人说：“求你与仆人同去。”回答说：“我可以去。” And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 于是以利沙与他们同去。到了约但河，就砍伐树木。 So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 有一人砍树的时候，斧头掉在水里，他就呼叫说：“哀哉！我主啊！这斧子是借的。” But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 神人问说：“掉在哪里了？”他将那地方指给以利沙看。以利沙砍了一根木头，抛在水里，斧头就漂上来了。 And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 以利沙说：“拿起来吧！”那人就伸手，拿起来了。 Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 亚兰王与以色列人争战，和他的臣仆商议说：“我要在某处某处安营。” Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 神人打发人去见以色列王，说：“你要谨慎，不要从某处经过，因为亚兰人从那里下来了。” And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 以色列王差人去窥探神人所告诉所警戒他去的地方，就防备未受其害，不止一两次。 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 亚兰王因这事心里惊疑，召了臣仆来，对他们说：“我们这里有谁帮助以色列王，你们不指给我吗？” Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 有一个臣仆说：“我主，我王！无人帮助他，只有以色列中的先知以利沙，将王在卧房所说的话，告诉以色列王了。” And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 王说：“你们去探他在哪里，我好打发人去捉拿他！”有人告诉王说：“他在多坍。” And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 王就打发车马和大军，往那里去。夜间到了，围困那城。 Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 神人的仆人清早起来出去，看见车马军兵围困了城。仆人对神人说：“哀哉！我主啊！我们怎样行才好呢？” And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 神人说：“不要惧怕！与我们同在的，比与他们同在的更多！” And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 以利沙祷告说：“耶和华啊！求你开这少年人的眼目，使他能看见。”耶和华开他的眼目，他就看见满山有火车火马围绕以利沙。 And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 敌人下到以利沙那里，以利沙祷告耶和华说：“求你使这些人的眼目昏迷。”耶和华就照以利沙的话，使他们的眼目昏迷。 And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 以利沙对他们说：“这不是那道，也不是那城；你们跟我去，我必领你们到所寻找的人那里。”于是，领他们到了撒玛利亚。 And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 他们进了撒玛利亚，以利沙祷告说：“耶和华啊！求你开这些人的眼目，使他们能看见。”耶和华开他们的眼目，他们就看见了。不料，是在撒玛利亚的城中。 And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 以色列王见了他们，就问以利沙说：“我父啊！我可以击杀他们吗？” And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 回答说：“不可击杀他们！就是你用刀用弓掳来的，岂可击杀他们吗(或作“也不可击杀，何况这些人呢？”)？”当在他们面前设摆饮食，使他们吃喝回到他们的主人那里。” And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 王就为他们预备了许多食物。他们吃喝完了，打发他们回到他们主人那里。从此，亚兰军不再犯以色列境了。 And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 此后，亚兰王便哈达聚集他的全军，上来围困撒玛利亚。 And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 于是撒玛利亚被围困，有饥荒，甚至一个驴头值银八十舍客勒，二升鸽子粪值银五舍客勒。 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 一日，以色列王在城上经过，有一个妇人向他呼叫说：“我主，我王啊！求你帮助。” And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 王说：“耶和华不帮助你，我从何处帮助你？是从禾场，是从酒醡呢？” And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 王问妇人说：“你有什么苦处？”她回答说：“这妇人对我说：‘将你的儿子取来，我们今日可以吃，明日可以吃我的儿子。’ And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 我们就煮了我的儿子吃了。次日我对她说：‘要将你的儿子取来，我们可以吃。’她却将她的儿子藏起来了。” So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 王听见妇人的话，就撕裂衣服。(王在城上经过)百姓看见王贴身穿着麻衣。 And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 王说：“我今日若容沙法的儿子以利沙的头仍在他项上，愿　神重重地降罚与我！” Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 那时，以利沙正坐在家中，长老也与他同坐。王打发一个伺候他的人去，他还没有到，以利沙对长老说：“你们看这凶手之子，打发人来斩我的头！你们看着使者来到，就关上门，用门将他推出去。在他后头不是有他主人脚步的响声吗？” But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 正说话的时候，使者来到，王也到了，说：“这灾祸是从耶和华那里来的，我何必再仰望耶和华呢？” And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor12_7">列王纪下 7</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 以利沙说：“你们要听耶和华的话，耶和华如此说：明日约到这时候，在撒玛利亚城门口，一细亚细面要卖银一舍客勒，二细亚大麦也要卖银一舍客勒。” Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 有一个搀扶王的军长，对神人说：“即便耶和华使天开了窗户，也不能有这事。”以利沙说：“你必亲眼看见，却不得吃。” Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 在城门那里有四个长大麻风的人，他们彼此说：“我们为何坐在这里等死呢？ And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 我们若说，进城去吧！城里有饥荒，必死在那里；若在这里坐着不动，也必是死。来吧！我们去投降亚兰人的军队，他们若留我们的活命，就活着；若杀我们，就死了吧！” If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 黄昏的时候，他们起来往亚兰人的营盘去；到了营边，不见一人在那里， And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 因为主使亚兰人的军队听见车马的声音，是大军的声音，他们就彼此说：“这必是以色列王贿买赫人的诸王和埃及人的诸王来攻击我们。” For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 所以，在黄昏的时候他们起来逃跑，撇下帐棚、马、驴，营盘照旧，只顾逃命。 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 那些长大麻风的到了营边，进了帐棚，吃了、喝了，且从其中拿出金银和衣服来去收藏了。回来，又进了一座帐棚，从其中拿出财物来去收藏了。 And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 那时他们彼此说：“我们所作的不好！今日是有好信息的日子，我们竟不作声！若等到天亮，罪必临到我们。来吧！我们与王家报信去。” Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 他们就去叫守城门的，告诉他们说：“我们到了亚兰人的营，不见一人在那里，也无人声，只有拴着的马和驴，帐棚都照旧。” So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 守城门的叫了众守门的人来，他们就进去与王家报信。 And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 王夜间起来，对臣仆说：“我告诉你们亚兰人向我们如何行：他们知道我们饥饿，所以离营，埋伏在田野，说：‘以色列人出城的时候，我们就活捉他们，得以进城。’” And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 有一个臣仆对王说：“我们不如用城里剩下之马中的五匹马(马和城里剩下的以色列人都是一样，快要灭绝)，打发人去窥探。” And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 于是取了两辆车和马，王差人去追寻亚兰军，说：“你们去窥探窥探！” They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 他们就追寻到约但河，看见满道上都是亚兰人急跑时丢弃的衣服器具。使者就回来报告王。 And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 众人就出去，掳掠亚兰人的营盘。于是一细亚细面卖银一舍客勒，二细亚大麦也卖银一舍客勒，正如耶和华所说的。 And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 王派搀扶他的那军长，在城门口弹压，众人在那里将他践踏，他就死了，正如神人在王下来见他的时候所说的。 And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 神人曾对王说：“明日约到这时候，在撒玛利亚城门口，二细亚大麦要卖银一舍客勒，一细亚细面也要卖银一舍客勒。” And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 那军长对神人说：“即便耶和华使天开了窗户，也不能有这事。”神人说：“你必亲眼看见，却不得吃。” And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 这话果然应验在他身上，因为众人在城门口将他践踏，他就死了。 And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor12_8">列王纪下 8</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 以利沙曾对所救活之子的那妇人说：“你和你的全家，要起身往你可住的地方去住，因为耶和华命饥荒降在这地七年。” Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 妇人就起身，照神人的话，带着全家往非利士地去，住了七年。 And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 七年完了，那妇人从非利士地回来，就出去为自己的房屋田地哀告王。 And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 那时王正与神人的仆人基哈西说：“请你将以利沙所行的一切大事告诉我。” And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 基哈西告诉王以利沙如何使死人复活，恰巧以利沙所救活她儿子的那妇人，为自己的房屋田地来哀告王。基哈西说：“我主我王！这就是那妇人，这是她的儿子，就是以利沙所救活的。” And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 王问那妇人，她就把那事告诉王。于是王为她派一个太监，说：“凡属这妇人的，都还给她，自从她离开本地直到今日，她田地的出产也都还给她。” And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 以利沙来到大马色，亚兰王便哈达正患病。有人告诉王说：“神人来到这里了。” And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 王就吩咐哈薛说：“你带着礼物去见神人，托他求问耶和华，我这病能好不能好？” And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 于是哈薛用四十个骆驼，驮着大马色的各样美物为礼物，去见以利沙。到了他那里，站在他面前，说：“你儿子亚兰王便哈达，打发我来见你，他问说：‘我这病能好不能好？’” So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 以利沙对哈薛说：“你回去告诉他说，这病必能好！但耶和华指示我，他必要死。” And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 神人定睛看着哈薛，甚至他惭愧，神人就哭了。 And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 哈薛说：“我主为什么哭？”回答说：“因为我知道你必苦害以色列人，用火焚烧他们的保障，用刀杀死他们的壮丁，摔死他们的婴孩，剖开他们的孕妇。” And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 哈薛说：“你仆人算什么，不过是一条狗，焉能行这大事呢？”以利沙回答说：“耶和华指示我，你必作亚兰王。” And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 哈薛离开以利沙，回去见他的主人。主人问他说：“以利沙对你说什么？”回答说：“他告诉我你必能好。” So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou shouldest surely recover.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 次日，哈薛拿被窝浸在水中，蒙住王的脸，王就死了。于是哈薛篡了他的位。 And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 以色列王亚哈的儿子约兰第五年，犹大王约沙法还在位的时候，约沙法的儿子约兰登基，作了犹大王。 And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 约兰登基的时候，年三十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王八年。 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 他行以色列诸王所行的，与亚哈家一样。因为他娶了亚哈的女儿为妻，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事。 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 耶和华却因他仆人大卫的缘故，仍不肯灭绝犹大，照他所应许大卫的话，永远赐灯光与他的子孙。 Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his children.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 约兰年间，以东人背叛犹大，脱离他的权下，自己立王。 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 约兰率领所有的战车往撒益去。夜间起来，攻打围困他的以东人和车兵长。犹大兵就逃跑，各回各家去了。 So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 这样，以东人背叛犹大，脱离他的权下，直到今日。那时立拿人也背叛了。 Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 约兰其余的事，凡他所行的都写在犹大列王记上。 And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 约兰与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城他列祖的坟地里。他儿子亚哈谢接续他作王。 And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 以色列王亚哈的儿子约兰十二年，犹大王约兰的儿子亚哈谢登基。 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 他登基的时候，年二十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王一年。他母亲名叫亚他利雅，是以色列王暗利的孙女。 Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 亚哈谢效法亚哈家行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，与亚哈家一样；因为他是亚哈家的女婿。 And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 他与亚哈的儿子约兰，同往基列的拉末去，与亚兰王哈薛争战；亚兰人打伤了约兰。 And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 约兰王回到耶斯列，医治在拉末与亚兰王哈薛打仗的时候所受的伤。犹大王约兰的儿子亚哈谢，因为亚哈的儿子约兰病了，就下到耶斯列看望他。 And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor12_9">列王纪下 9</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 先知以利沙叫了一个先知门徒来，吩咐他说：“你束上腰，手拿这瓶膏油，往基列的拉末去。 And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramothgilead:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 到了那里，要寻找宁示的孙子，约沙法的儿子耶户。使他从同僚中起来，带他进严密的屋子， And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 将瓶里的膏油倒在他头上，说：‘耶和华如此说：我膏你作以色列王。’说完了，就开门逃跑，不要迟延。” Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 于是那少年先知往基列的拉末去了。 So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 到了那里，看见众军长都坐着，就说：“将军哪！我有话对你说。”耶户说：“我们众人里，你要对哪一个说呢？”回答说：“将军哪！我要对你说。” And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 耶户就起来，进了屋子，少年人将膏油倒在他头上，对他说：“耶和华以色列的　神如此说：‘我膏你作耶和华民以色列的王。 And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 你要击杀你主人亚哈的全家，我好在耶洗别身上伸我仆人众先知和耶和华一切仆人流血的冤。 And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 亚哈全家必都灭亡，凡属亚哈的男丁，无论是困住的、自由的，我必从以色列中剪除， For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 使亚哈的家象尼八儿子耶罗波安的家，又象亚希雅儿子巴沙的家。 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 耶洗别必在耶斯列田里被狗所吃，无人葬埋。’”说完了，少年人就开门逃跑了。 And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 耶户出来，回到他主人的臣仆那里，有一人问他说：“平安吗？这狂妄的人来见你有什么事呢？”回答说：“你们认得那人，也知道他说什么。” Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 他们说：“这是假话，你据实地告诉我们。”回答说：“他如此如此对我说。他说，耶和华如此说：‘我膏你作以色列王。’” And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 他们就急忙各将自己的衣服铺在上层台阶，使耶户坐在其上；他们吹角，说：“耶户作王了！” Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 这样，宁示的孙子，约沙法的儿子耶户，背叛约兰。先是约兰和以色列众人，因为亚兰王哈薛的缘故，把守基列的拉末； So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 但约兰王回到耶斯列，医治与亚兰王哈薛打仗所受的伤。耶户说：“若合你们的意思，就不容人逃出城往耶斯列报信去。” But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 于是耶户坐车往耶斯列去，因为约兰病卧在那里。犹大王亚哈谢已经下去看望他。 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 有一个守望的人，站在耶斯列的楼上，看见耶户带着一群人来，就说：“我看见一群人。”约兰说：“打发一个骑马的去，迎接他们，问说，平安不平安？” And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 骑马的就去，迎接耶户，说：“王问说，平安不平安？”耶户说：“平安不平安与你何干？你转在我后头吧！”守望的人又说：“使者到了他们那里，却不回来。” So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 王又打发一个骑马的去。这人到了他们那里，说：“王问说，平安不平安？”耶户说：“平安不平安与你何干？你转在我后头吧！” Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 守望的人又说：“他到了他们那里，也不回来！车赶得甚猛，象宁示的孙子耶户的赶法。” And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 约兰吩咐说：“套车！”人就给他套车。以色列王约兰和犹大王亚哈谢，各坐自己的车出去迎接耶户，在耶斯列人拿伯的田那里遇见他。 And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 约兰见耶户就说：“耶户啊！平安吗？”耶户说：“你母亲耶洗别的淫行邪术这样多，焉能平安呢？” And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 约兰就转车逃跑，对亚哈谢说：“亚哈谢啊！反了！” And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 耶户开满了弓，射中约兰的脊背，箭从心窝穿出，约兰就仆倒在车上。 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 耶户对他的军长毕甲说：“你把他抛在耶斯列人拿伯的田间。你当追想，你我一同坐车跟随他父亚哈的时候，耶和华对亚哈所说的预言， Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 说：‘我昨日看见拿伯的血和他众子的血，我必在这块田上报应你。’这是耶和华说的，现在你要照着耶和华的话，把他抛在这田间。” Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 犹大王亚哈谢见这光景，就从园亭之路逃跑。耶户追赶他说：“把这人也杀在车上。”到了靠近以伯莲姑珥的坡上击伤了他，他逃到米吉多，就死在那里。 But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 他的臣仆用车将他的尸首送到耶路撒冷，葬在大卫城他自己的坟墓里，与他列祖同葬。 And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 亚哈谢登基，作犹大王的时候，是在亚哈的儿子约兰第十一年。 And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 耶户到了耶斯列。耶洗别听见就擦粉、梳头，从窗户里往外观看。 And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 耶户进门的时候，耶洗别说：“杀主人的心利啊！平安吗？” And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 耶户抬头向窗户观看，说：“谁顺从我？”有两三个太监从窗户往外看他。 And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 耶户说：“把她扔下来！”他们就把她扔下来。她的血溅在墙上和马上，于是把她践踏了。 And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 耶户进去，吃了喝了，吩咐说：“你们把这被咒诅的妇人葬埋了，因为她是王的女儿。” And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 他们就去葬埋她，只寻得她的头骨和脚，并手掌。 And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 他们回去告诉耶户，耶户说：“这正应验耶和华藉他仆人提斯比人以利亚所说的话，说：“在耶斯列田间，狗必吃耶洗别的肉； Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 耶洗别的尸首必在耶斯列田间如同粪土，甚至人不能说，这是耶洗别。” And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor12_10">列王纪下 10</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 亚哈有七十个儿子在撒玛利亚。耶户写信送到撒玛利亚，通知耶斯列的首领，就是长老和教养亚哈众子的人，说： And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: “你们那里既有你们主人的众子，和车马、器械、坚固城； Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 接了这信，就可以在你们主人的众子中，选择一个贤能合宜的，使他坐他父亲的位；你们也可以为你们主人的家争战。” Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他们却甚惧怕，彼此说：“二王在他面前尚且站立不住，我们怎能站得住呢？” But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 家宰、邑宰和长老，并教养众子的人，打发人去见耶户，说：“我们是你的仆人，凡你所吩咐我们的都必遵行，我们不立谁作王，你看怎样好就怎样行。” And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 耶户又给他们写信说：“你们若归顺我，听从我的话，明日这时候，要将你们主人众子的首级带到耶斯列来见我。”那时王的儿子七十人，都住在教养他们那城中的尊贵人家里。 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 信一到，他们就把王的七十个儿子杀了，将首级装在筐里，送到耶斯列耶户那里。 And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 有使者来告诉耶户说：“他们将王众子的首级送来了。”耶户说：“将首级在城门口堆作两堆，搁到明日。” And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 次日早晨，耶户出来，站着对众民说：“你们都是公义的，我背叛我主人，将他杀了，这些人却是谁杀的呢？ And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 由此可知，耶和华指着亚哈家所说的话，一句没有落空；因为耶和华藉他仆人以利亚所说的话，都成就了。” Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 凡亚哈家在耶斯列所剩下的人和他的大臣、密友、祭司，耶户尽都杀了，没有留下一个。 So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 耶户起身，往撒玛利亚去。在路上，牧人剪羊毛之处， And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house in the way,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 遇见犹大王亚哈谢的弟兄，问他们说：“你们是谁？”回答说：“我们是亚哈谢的弟兄，现在下去，要问王和太后的众子安。” Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 耶户吩咐说：“活捉他们！”跟从的人就活捉了他们，将他们杀在剪羊毛之处的坑边，共四十二人，没有留下一个。 And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 耶户从那里前行，恰遇利甲的儿子约拿达来迎接他，耶户问他安，对他说：“你诚心待我象我诚心待你吗？”约拿达回答说：“是。”耶户说：“若是这样，你向我伸手。”他就伸手；耶户拉他上车。 And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 耶户说：“你和我同去，看我为耶和华怎样热心。”于是请他坐在车上， And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 到了撒玛利亚，就把撒玛利亚亚哈家剩下的人都杀了，直到灭尽，正如耶和华对以利亚所说的。 And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 耶户招聚众民，对他们说：“亚哈事奉巴力还冷淡，耶户却更热心。 And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 现在我要给巴力献大祭。应当叫巴力的众先知和一切拜巴力的人，并巴力的众祭司，都到我这里来，不可缺少一个，凡不来的必不得活。”耶户这样行，是用诡计要杀尽拜巴力的人。 Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 耶户说：“要为巴力宣告严肃会。”于是宣告了。 And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 耶户差人走遍以色列地，凡拜巴力的人都来齐了，没有一个不来的。他们进了巴力庙，巴力庙中从前边直到后边都满了人。 And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 耶户吩咐掌管礼服的人说：“拿出礼服来，给一切拜巴力的人穿。”他就拿出礼服来给了他们。 And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 耶户和利甲的儿子约拿达进了巴力庙，对拜巴力的人说：“你们察看察看，在你们这里不可有耶和华的仆人，只可容留拜巴力的人。” And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 耶户和约拿达进去，献平安祭和燔祭。耶户先安排八十人在庙外，吩咐说：“我将这些人交在你们手中，若有一人脱逃，谁放的，必叫他偿命。” And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 耶户献完了燔祭，就出来吩咐护卫兵和众军长，说：“你们进去杀他们，不容一人出来。”护卫兵和军长就用刀杀他们，将尸首抛出去，便到巴力庙的城去了， And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 将巴力庙中的柱像都拿出来烧了： And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 毁坏了巴力柱像，拆毁了巴力庙作为厕所，直到今日。 And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 这样，耶户在以色列中灭了巴力。 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 只是耶户不离开尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪，就是拜伯特利和但的金牛犊。 Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 耶和华对耶户说：“因你办好我眼中看为正的事，照我的心意待亚哈家，你的子孙必接续你坐以色列的国位，直到四代。” And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 只是耶户不尽心遵守耶和华以色列　神的律法，不离开耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 在那些日子，耶和华才割裂以色列国，使哈薛攻击以色列的境界， In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 乃是约但河东、基列全地，从靠近亚嫩谷边的亚罗珥起，就是基列和巴珊的迦得人、流便人、玛拿西人之地。 From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 耶户其余的事，凡他所行的和他的勇力，都写在以色列诸王记上。 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 耶户与他列祖同睡，葬在撒玛利亚。他儿子约哈斯接续他作王。 And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria.

And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 以利沙对他说：“你取弓箭来！”王就取了弓箭来。 And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows.

margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 亚述王应允了他，就上去攻打大马色，将城攻取，杀了利汛，把居民掳到吉珥。 And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 亚哈斯王上大马色去迎接亚述王提革拉毗列色，在大马色看见一座坛，就照坛的规模样式作法画了图样，送到祭司乌利亚那里。 And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 祭司乌利亚照着亚哈斯王从大马色送来的图样，在亚哈斯王没有从大马色回来之先，建筑一座坛。 And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 王从大马色回来看见坛，就近前来，在坛上献祭； And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 烧燔祭素祭，浇奠祭，将平安祭牲的血洒在坛上。 And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 又将耶和华面前的铜坛，从耶和华殿和新坛的中间搬到新坛的北边。 And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 亚哈斯王吩咐祭司乌利亚说：“早晨的燔祭，晚上的素祭，王的燔祭素祭，国内众民的燔祭素祭奠祭，都要烧在大坛上。燔祭牲和平安祭牲的血也要洒在这坛上，只是铜坛我要用以求问耶和华。” And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 祭司乌利亚就照着亚哈斯王所吩咐的行了。 Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 亚哈斯王打掉盆座四面镶着的心子，把盆从座上挪下来，又将铜海从驮海的铜牛上搬下来，放在铺石地。 And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 又因亚述王的缘故，将耶和华殿为安息日所盖的廊子，和王从外入殿的廊子，挪移围绕耶和华的殿。 And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 亚哈斯其余所行的事，都写在犹大列王记上。 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 亚哈斯与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城他列祖的坟地里。他儿子希西家接续他作王。 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor12_17">列王纪下 17</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 犹大王亚哈斯十二年，以拉的儿子何细亚在撒玛利亚登基，作以色列王九年。 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，只是不象在他以前的以色列诸王。 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 亚述王撒缦以色上来攻击何细亚，何细亚就服事他，给他进贡。 Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 何细亚背叛，差人去见埃及王梭，不照往年所行的与亚述王进贡。亚述王知道了，就把他锁禁，囚在监里。 And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 亚述王上来攻击以色列遍地，上到撒玛利亚，围困三年。 Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 何细亚第九年亚述王攻取了撒玛利亚，将以色列人掳到亚述，把他们安置在哈腊与歌散的哈博河边，并玛代人的城邑。 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 这是因以色列人得罪那领他们出埃及地，脱离埃及王法老手的耶和华他们的　神，去敬畏别神， For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 随从耶和华在他们面前所赶出外邦人的风俗，和以色列诸王所立的条规。 And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 以色列人暗中行不正的事，违背耶和华他们的　神，在他们所有的城邑，从了望楼直到坚固城，建筑邱坛； And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 在各高冈上，各青翠树下，立柱像和木偶； And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 在邱坛上烧香，效法耶和华在他们面前赶出的外邦人所行的，又行恶事惹动耶和华的怒气； And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 且事奉偶像，就是耶和华警戒他们不可行的。 For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 但耶和华藉众先知、先见，劝戒以色列人和犹大人，说：“当离开你们的恶行，谨守我的诫命律例，遵行我吩咐你们列祖，并借我仆人众先知所传给你们的律法。” Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 他们却不听从，竟硬着颈项，效法他们列祖，不信服耶和华他们的　神。 Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 厌弃他的律例和他与他们列祖所立的约，并劝戒他们的话，随从虚无的神，自己成为虚妄，效法周围的外邦人，就是耶和华嘱咐他们不可效法的。 And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 离弃耶和华他们　神的一切诫命，为自己铸了两个牛犊的像，立了亚舍拉，敬拜天上的万象，事奉巴力。 And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 又使他们的儿女经火，用占卜，行法术，卖了自己，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，惹动他的怒气。 And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 所以耶和华向以色列人大大发怒，从自己面前赶出他们，只剩下犹大一个支派。 Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 犹大人也不遵守耶和华他们　神的诫命，随从以色列人所立的条规。 Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 耶和华就厌弃以色列全族，使他们受苦，把他们交在抢夺他们的人手中，以致赶出他们离开自己面前。 And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 将以色列国从大卫家夺回，他们就立尼八的儿子耶罗波安作王。耶罗波安引诱以色列人不随从耶和华，陷在大罪里。 For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 以色列人犯耶罗波安所犯的一切罪，总不离开， For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 以致耶和华从自己面前赶出他们，正如藉他仆人众先知所说的。这样，以色列人从本地被掳到亚述，直到今日。 Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 亚述王从巴比伦、古他、亚瓦、哈马，和西法瓦音迁移人来，安置在撒玛利亚的城邑，代替以色列人；他们就得了撒玛利亚，住在其中。 And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 他们才住那里的时候，不敬畏耶和华，所以耶和华叫狮子进入他们中间，咬死了些人。 And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 有人告诉亚述王，说：“你所迁移安置在撒玛利亚各城的那些民，不知道那地之神的规矩，所以那神叫狮子进入他们中间，咬死他们。” Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 亚述王就吩咐说：“叫所掳来的祭司回去一个，使他住在那里，将那地之神的规矩指教那些民。” Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 于是有一个从撒玛利亚掳去的祭司回来，住在伯特利，指教他们怎样敬畏耶和华。 Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 然而，各族之人在所住的城里，各为自己制造神像，安置在撒玛利亚人所造有邱坛的殿中。 Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 巴比伦人造疏割比讷像；古他人造匿甲像；哈马人造亚示玛像； And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 亚瓦人造匿哈和他珥他像；西法瓦音人用火焚烧儿女，献给西法瓦音的神亚得米勒和亚拿米勒。 And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 他们惧怕耶和华，也从他们中间立邱坛的祭司，为他们在有邱坛的殿中献祭。 So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 他们又惧怕耶和华，又事奉自己的神，从何邦迁移，就随何邦的风俗。 They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 他们直到如今仍照先前的风俗去行，不专心敬畏耶和华，不全守自己的规矩、典章，也不遵守耶和华吩咐雅各后裔的律法、诫命(雅各，就是从前耶和华起名叫以色列的)。 Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 耶和华曾与他们立约，嘱咐他们说：“不可敬畏别神，不可跪拜事奉他，也不可向他献祭。 With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 但那用大能和伸出来的膀臂领你们出埃及地的耶和华，你们当敬畏、跪拜，向他献祭。 But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 他给你们写的律例、典章、律法、诫命，你们应当永远谨守遵行，不可敬畏别神。 And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">38: 我耶和华与你们所立的约，你们不可忘记，也不可敬畏别神。 And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">39: 但要敬畏耶和华你们的　神，他必救你们脱离一切仇敌的手。” But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">40: 他们却不听从，仍照先前的风俗去行。 Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">41: 如此这些民又惧怕耶和华，又事奉他们的偶像。他们子子孙孙也都照样行，效法他们的祖宗，直到今日。 So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor12_18">列王纪下 18</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 以色列王以拉的儿子何细亚第三年，犹大王亚哈斯的儿子希西家登基。 Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 他登基的时候，年二十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王二十九年。他母亲名叫亚比，是撒迦利雅的女儿。 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 希西家行耶和华眼中看为正的事，效法他祖大卫一切所行的。 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 他废去邱坛，毁坏柱像，砍下木偶，打碎摩西所造的铜蛇，因为到那时以色列人仍向铜蛇烧香。希西家叫铜蛇为铜块(或作“人称铜蛇为铜像”)。 He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 希西家倚靠耶和华以色列的　神，在他前后的犹大列王中没有一个及他的。 He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 因为他专靠耶和华，总不离开，谨守耶和华所吩咐摩西的诫命。 For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 耶和华与他同在，他无论往何处去，尽都亨通。他背叛，不肯事奉亚述王。 And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 希西家攻击非利士人，直到迦萨，并迦萨的四境，从了望楼到坚固城。 He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 希西家王第四年，就是以色列王以拉的儿子何细亚第七年，亚述王撒缦以色上来围困撒玛利亚。 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 过了三年就攻取了城。希西家第六年，以色列王何细亚第九年，撒玛利亚被攻取了。 And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 亚述王将以色列人掳到亚述，把他们安置在哈腊与歌散的哈博河边，并玛代人的城邑。 And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 都因他们不听从耶和华他们　神的话，违背他的约，就是耶和华仆人摩西吩咐他们所当守的。 Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 希西家王十四年，亚述王西拿基立上来攻击犹大的一切坚固城，将城攻取。 Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 犹大王希西家差人往拉吉去，见亚述王，说：“我有罪了！求你离开我；凡你罚我的，我必承当。”于是亚述王罚犹大王希西家银子三百他连得，金子三十他连得。 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 希西家就把耶和华殿里和王宫府库里所有的银子都给了他。 And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 那时，犹大王希西家将耶和华殿门上的金子和他自己包在柱上的金子都刮下来，给了亚述王。 At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 亚述王从拉吉差遣他珥探、拉伯撒利，和拉伯沙基率领大军往耶路撒冷，到希西家王那里去。他们上到耶路撒冷，就站在上池的水沟旁，在漂布地的大路上。 And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 他们呼叫王的时候，就有希勒家的儿子家宰以利亚敬，并书记舍伯那和亚萨的儿子史官约亚，出来见他们。 And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 拉伯沙基说：“你们去告诉希西家说，亚述大王如此说：‘你所倚靠的有什么可仗赖的呢？ And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 你说有打仗的计谋和能力，我看不过是虚话。你到底倚靠谁，才背叛我呢？ Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 看哪！你所倚靠的埃及，是那压伤的苇杖；人若靠这杖，就必刺透他的手。埃及王法老向一切倚靠他的人也是这样。 Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 你们若对我说，“我们倚靠耶和华我们的　神；”希西家岂不是将　神的邱坛和祭坛废去，且对犹大和耶路撒冷的人说，“你们当在耶路撒冷这坛前敬拜吗？” But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 现在你把当头给我主亚述王，我给你二千匹马，看你这一面骑马的人够不够。 Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 若不然，怎能打败我主臣仆中最小的军长呢？你竟倚靠埃及的战车马兵吗？ How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: 现在我上来攻击毁灭这地，岂没有耶和华的意思吗？耶和华吩咐我说，你上去攻击毁灭这地吧！’” Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 希勒家的儿子以利亚敬和舍伯那，并约亚，对拉伯沙基说：“求你用亚兰言语和仆人说话，因为我们懂得；不要用犹大言语和我们说话，达到城上百姓的耳中。” Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 拉伯沙基说：“我主差遣我来，岂是单对你和你的主说这些话吗？不也是对这些坐在城上，要与你们一同吃自己粪、喝自己尿的人说吗？” But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 于是拉伯沙基站着，用犹大言语大声喊着说：“你们当听亚述大王的话！ Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: 王如此说：你们不要被希西家欺哄了，因他不能救你们脱离我的手， Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 也不要听希西家，使你们倚靠耶和华说，耶和华必要拯救我们，这城必不交在亚述王的手中。 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 不要听希西家的话！因亚述王如此说，你们要与我和好，出来投降我，各人就可以吃自己葡萄树和无花果树的果子，喝自己井里的水。 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern:</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: 等我来领你们到一个地方与你们本地一样，就是有五谷和新酒之地，有粮食和葡萄园之地，有橄榄树和蜂蜜之地，好使你们存活，不至于死。希西家劝导你们说，耶和华必拯救我们。你们不要听他的话。 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 列国的神，有哪一个救他本国脱离亚述王的手呢？ Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 哈马亚珥拔的神在哪里呢？西法瓦音希拿以瓦的神在哪里呢？他们曾救撒玛利亚脱离我的手吗？ Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 这些国的神有谁曾救自己的国脱离我的手呢？难道耶和华能救耶路撒冷脱离我的手吗？” Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 百姓静默不言，并不回答一句；因为王曾吩咐说：“不要回答他。” But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 当下，希勒家的儿子家宰以利亚敬和书记舍伯那，并亚萨的儿子史官约亚都撕裂衣服，来到希西家那里，将拉伯沙基的话告诉了他。 Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor12_19">列王纪下 19</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 希西家王听见，就撕裂衣服，披上麻布，进了耶和华的殿。 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 使家宰以利亚敬和书记舍伯那，并祭司中的长老都披上麻布，去见亚摩斯的儿子先知以赛亚。 And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: 对他说：“希西家如此说，今日是急难责罚凌辱的日子，就如妇人将要生产婴孩，却没有力量生产。 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 或者耶和华你的　神听见拉伯沙基的一切话，就是他主人亚述王打发他来辱骂永生　神的话；耶和华你的　神听见这话，就发斥责。故此，求你为余剩的民，扬声祷告。” It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: 希西家王的臣仆，就去见以赛亚。 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 以赛亚对他们说：“要这样对你们的主人说，耶和华如此说：你听见亚述王的仆人亵渎我的话，不要惧怕。 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 我必惊动(原文作“使灵进入”)他的心，他要听见风声，就归回本地。我必使他在那里倒在刀下。” Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 拉伯沙基回去，正遇见亚述王攻打立拿，原来他早听见亚述王拔营离开拉吉。 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 亚述王听见人论古实王特哈加说：“他出来要与你争战。”于是亚述王又打发使者去见希西家，吩咐他们说： And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: “你们对犹大王希西家如此说，不要听你所倚靠的　神欺哄你说，耶路撒冷必不交在亚述王的手中。 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 你总听说亚述诸王向列国所行的，乃是尽行灭绝，难道你还能得救吗？ Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 我列祖所毁灭的，就是歌散、哈兰、利色，和属提拉撒的伊甸人，这些国的神何曾拯救这些国呢？ Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 哈马的王、亚珥拔的王、西法瓦音城的王、希拿和以瓦的王，都在哪里呢？” Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 希西家从使者手里接过书信来，看完了就上耶和华的殿，将书信在耶和华面前展开。 And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">15: 希西家向耶和华祷告，说：“坐在二基路伯上耶和华以色列的　神啊！你是天下万国的　神，你曾创造天地。 And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">16: 耶和华啊！求你侧耳而听！耶和华啊！求你睁眼而看！要听西拿基立打发使者来辱骂永生　神的话。 LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">17: 耶和华啊！亚述诸王果然使列国和列国之地变为荒凉， Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">18: 将列国的神像都扔在火里；因为它本不是神，乃是人手所造的，是木头石头的，所以灭绝它。 And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">19: 耶和华我们的　神啊！现在求你救我们脱离亚述王的手，使天下万国都知道惟独你耶和华是　神！” Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God, even thou only.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">20: 亚摩斯的儿子以赛亚，就打发人去见希西家，说：“耶和华以色列的　神如此说：‘你既然求我攻击亚述王西拿基立，我已听见了。’ Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">21: 耶和华论他这样说：锡安的处女藐视你，嗤笑你；耶路撒冷的女子向你摇头。 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">22: 你辱骂谁？亵渎谁？扬起声来，高举眼目，攻击谁呢？乃是攻击以色列的圣者！ Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">23: 你藉你的使者辱骂主，并说：‘我率领许多战车上山顶，到黎巴嫩极深之处；我要砍伐其中高大的香柏树和佳美的松树；我必上极高之处，进入肥田的树林。 By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">24: 我已经在外邦挖井喝水，我必用脚掌踏干埃及的一切河。’ I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">25: “耶和华说：我早先所作的，古时所立的，就是现在藉你使坚固城荒废，变为乱堆，这事你岂没有听见吗？ Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">26: 所以其中的居民力量甚小，惊惶羞愧。他们象野草，象青菜，如房顶上的草，又如未长成而枯干的禾稼。 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">27: 你坐下，你出去，你进来，你向我发烈怒，我都知道。 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">28: 因你向我发烈怒，又因你狂傲的话达到我耳中，我就要用钩子钩上你的鼻子，把嚼环放在你口里，使你从你来的路转回去。 Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">29: “以色列人哪！我赐你们一个证据：你们今年要吃自生的，明年也要吃自长的；至于后年，你们要耕种收割，栽植葡萄园，吃其中的果子。 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">30: 犹大家所逃脱余剩的，仍要往下扎根，向上结果。 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">31: 必有余剩的民，从耶路撒冷而出；必有逃脱的人，从锡安山而来。耶和华的热心，必成就这事。 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">32: “所以耶和华论亚述王如此说：他必不得来到这城，也不在这里射箭，不得拿盾牌到城前，也不筑垒攻城。 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">33: 他从哪条路来，必从哪条路回去，必不得来到这城。这是耶和华说的。 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">34: 因我为自己的缘故，又为我仆人大卫的缘故，必保护拯救这城。” For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">35: 当夜耶和华的使者出去，在亚述营中杀了十八万五千人。清早有人起来，一看，都是死尸了。 And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">36: 亚述王西拿基立就拔营回去，住在尼尼微。 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">37: 一日在他的神尼斯洛庙里叩拜，他儿子亚得米勒和沙利色用刀杀了他，就逃到亚拉腊地。他儿子以撒哈顿接续他作王。 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</p><div style="margin:15px;font-weight:600;" id="Chaptor12_20">列王纪下 20</div><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">1: 那时希西家病得要死。亚摩斯的儿子先知以赛亚去见他，对他说：“耶和华如此说：你当留遗命与你的家，因为你必死，不能活了。” In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">2: 希西家就转脸朝墙，祷告耶和华说： Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">3: “耶和华啊！求你记念我在你面前怎样存完全的心，按诚实行事，又作你眼中所看为善的。”希西家就痛哭了。 I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">4: 以赛亚出来，还没有到中院(“院”或作“城”)耶和华的话就临到他，说： And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">5: “你回去，告诉我民的君希西家说：‘耶和华你祖大卫的　神如此说：我听见了你的祷告，看见了你的眼泪，我必医治你。到第三日，你必上到耶和华的殿。 Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">6: 我必加增你十五年的寿数，并且我要救你和这城脱离亚述王的手。我为自己和我仆人大卫的缘故，必保护这城。’” And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">7: 以赛亚说：“当取一块无花果饼来。”人就取了来，贴在疮上，王便痊愈了。 And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">8: 希西家问以赛亚说：“耶和华必医治我，到第三日，我能上耶和华的殿，有什么兆头呢？” And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">9: 以赛亚说：“耶和华必成就他所说的，这是他给你的兆头：你要日影向前进十度呢？是要往后退十度呢？” And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">10: 希西家回答说：“日影向前进十度容易，我要日影往后退十度。” And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">11: 先知以赛亚求告耶和华，耶和华就使亚哈斯的日晷向前进的日影，往后退了十度。 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">12: 那时，巴比伦王巴拉但的儿子比罗达巴拉但听见希西家病而痊愈，就送书信和礼物给他。 At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">13: 希西家听从使者的话，就把他宝库的金子、银子、香料、贵重的膏油，和他武库的一切军器，并他所有的财宝，都给他们看。他家中和他全国之内，希西家没有一样不给他们看的。 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.</p><p style="border: 1px solid gray; margin:5px auto;padding:10px;">14: 于是先知以赛亚来见希西家王，问他说：“这些人说什么？他们从哪里来见你？”希西家说：“他们从远方的巴比伦来。” Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee?
